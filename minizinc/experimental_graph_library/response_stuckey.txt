Sorry I received it when I was on summer holiday, I did have a brief look and it looked interesting and usable.

Feel free to announce it.

We should probably try to incorporate it into the official MiniZinc library at some point
but we would need to go through and just check that we agree with the design choices
e.g.

hamiltonian_cycle/1

makes use of

cycle/3 wit and unused cost argument

not sure that is wise?

Also there are plenty of promise_total that I would have to think about!
