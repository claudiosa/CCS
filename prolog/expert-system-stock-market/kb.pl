Rule 4: IF open piece and low price rise and at the same time
close price also rising then investing money for particular
month may be harmful.

Rule 5: IF volume and open price of share increase then share
prices also increase i.e. sell share and earn profit.

Rule 6: IF open price and close price rising and at the same
time low price also rising then buy companyâ€˜s share at low
price.

Rule 7: IF volume and close price falls down then do not invest
money.

Rule8:IF inflation rate increases then economical growth of the
country also increases i.e. share market performs outstanding.
