* 3 files take part of this system:
  - input_output_predicates.pl : predicates for Input/Output and others
  - kb.pl  : knowledge base -- YOU CAN ADD rules here as you wish
  - main-user-interface.pl : user interface, engine, options etc -- main program is called by the 'run' predicate
* Put these 3 files in any directory 
* Go to this directory ... and enjoy it!

Using:

$ swipl -q -f  main-user-interface.pl -t run

By swi-prolog enviroment, just load:
