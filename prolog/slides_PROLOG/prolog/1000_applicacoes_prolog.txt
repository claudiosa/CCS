<Program>	ADES (ATP Design Expert System)
<Number> 	425
<Domain>	Logic Circuit Design.
<Purpose>	Automatic design of the logic circuits constituting an 
Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, starting from the station 
topography.
<Description>	ADES (ATP Design Expert System) is an expert system 
for automatically designing the logic circuits which constitute an 
Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system 
of stations belonging to a certain class determined by the Italian 
Railway Station Authority. Starting from the drawing of the station 
topography, introduced through a 
graphic input interface, ADES determines the circuit design for the 
ATP system of the station, and finally presents the user the logic 
circuits through a graphic
 output interface. The user can adjust the resulting design through 
the interface, and finally plot it. Moreover, several intermediate 
documents - usually adopted by the Italian 
Railway Station Authority  for validating the project, are also 
automatically produced by ADES.                 
ADES inference engine has been implemented by using the Prolog 
language, and meta-interpretation techniques in particular. 
Implementing both the expert system and some of its environment tools 
in Prolog has led to the rapid prototyping of the overall system. 
Optimization techniques, and partial evaluation in particular, have also 
been applied in order to obtain efficient execution.

<Description>	The ADP system consists of two distinct knowledge 
bases supplying welding engineers in the diagnosis and the planning 
of technological parameters for gas-shielded welding applications.  
Welding knowledge is modeled in terms of objects and rules.  For 
diagnosis purposes hypotheses have been implemented connecting system 
symptoms with a set of applyable error recovery
measures.  For planning a set of rules has been defined deriving the values 
of a welding schedule.

<Program>	ADRAM (after an ICL program of the same name).
<Number> 	406
<Domain>	Data Conversion.
<Purpose>	Syntax-directed data converter.
<Description>	Originally developed for porting files of 
Government and other economic data from ICL 1900, ICL 2900, and IBM 
tapes to VAX VMS. We wanted to change the file structures as we did 
this (e.g. swap fields within records), rather than
translating them verbatim. Therefore decided to write a general 
purpose converter, whose inputs were (1)syntactic description of file 
layouts at the record and field level, in a notation which looked 
like a mixture of Cobol data definitions and Pascal record 
structures; (2) a description of the machine architectures: word 
sizes, byte directions,
and so on. ADRAM generated from these an Algol68
program which when ran, did the actual conversion.

alerts, so the user could immediatly see what's previously append.  
The knowledge base contains a set of parameters which could be 
modified during the session (without recompiling)
.
The user can consult an historic, rebuild the context, replay the 
analyse and see why a diagnosis was product (facts values and rules 
used).  He can modify the knowledge base with ALTES compiler and test 
it with an old journalized context to verify new rules. This allows 
specifics uses.
Graphs and journal generated by ALTES are a real help for understanding and 
tuning the mainframe.

<Description>	Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are the most
backward and economically weaker segments of the Indian society. 
Historically they have been neglected and discriminated against 
through the centuries.  Government of
India brought in a special legislation for their uplift and development. 
Orders and instructions have been issued from time to time promulgating 
concessions to encourage their employment in the civil services of the 
Government and to safeguard their interests while in service. A logic 
programming based expert system has been developed for giving advice on 
this piece of legislation , called Reservation Policy of Scheduled Castes 
and Scheduled Tribes.

<Program>	ASIGNA
<Number> 	59
<Domain>	Chemical processes scheduling
<Purpose>	This program is meant to schedule chemical processes sharing 
resources. It handles disjunctive constraints and large time periods.
<Description>	Resource-allocation problems occur frequently in 
chemical plans. Different processes often share pieces of equipment 
such as reactors and filters. The program ASIGNA allocates equipment 
to some given set of processes. Each process is described as a 
sequence of stages. At each stage, a process uses some piece of 
equipment for a certain time period. 

The problems solved with our program resemble critical-path problems that 
can be solved with commercial packages. Unlike some of these packages, our 
program can handle disjunctive constraints. To handle such constraints, we 
use a generalization of the " domains" pioneered by the CHIP language. We 
have modified these domains to efficiently represent numerous elements, as 
happens in practical resource-allocation problems.

<Purpose>	Exercises in syllogistic reasoning.
<Description>	BARBARA provides exercises in syllogistic 
reasoning. The instructor can provide the examples that he or she 
wishes to use in drilling students; examples are kept in a separate 
ASCII file which the instructor can edit with a wordprocessor or 
editor.  This file contains the sentences which are the premises of a 
particular example, the logical form of these sentences, and the 
lexicon of terms which appear in the premises.
The student may choose to use either the traditional or the modern 
rules for the syllogism and can change which rules are being used at 
any time.  The student enters, in English, a conclusion which 
follows.  Barbara parses the student's sentence and identifies the 
sentence's logical form.  Barbara checks to see if that logical form 
follows by first-order logic
from the form of the premises, and responds accordingly,                   
seeking to give the strongest possible reply for both correct and incorrect 
answers.

error-prone and is governed by a complex set of rules.
It is based on a knowledge environment called KNET which is a semantic 
network with inheritance. The configurator performs an "ordered walk"

experts. At each stage the user can revise configuration specifications 
since the system is interactive. The system does not permit invalid choices 
regarding items and quantities. The system is also linked tothe products

<Program>	BIS/Estimator System
<Number> 	92
<Domain>	Data Processing management
<Purpose>	
<Description>	The BIS/Estimator system provides estimates for all 
phases of development of a data processing application from the initial 
feasibility study down to the fielding of the implemented system. 
BIS/estimator allows the use of five different estimating methods, which 
can be divided into two main categories: soft and hard. Each phase of the 
project can be analysed in detail at different levels. This makes it 
possible to produce cost estimates for the whole project, the individual 
phases or any task within a particular phase. The output from the program 
is a set of reports which include high-level project summaries, estimates 
at project, phase and task levels and reports which contain the data on 
which the estimates are based. These estimates can be loaded directly into 
other systems such as Lotus 1-2-3 or Project Manager Workbench (PMW). There 
is a close relationship between the number of outputs the system produces 
and the effor required to produce these reports. This makes it possible to 
produce a high-level, soft, cost estimate before carrying out even a 
feasibility study. The hard estimates which allow easy comparisons between 
the new project and a selection of old projects can provide a useful 
framework for calibrating the costing of new projects. BIS/Estimator can 
explain its estimates using heuristic knowledge encoded in rules associated 
with each task. It also draws expertise from a number of other sources, 
including statistical knowledge, scheduling, and mathematical techniques 
such as the Function Point Analysis method.

<Program>	CADRAN
<Number> 	311
<Domain>	CAD.
<Purpose>	Transformation of CAD Data.
<Description>	The systems transforms data between different CAD 
systems.
Complex design projects often require the combination of several CAD 
systems (Design, simulation, Finite Elements).  The transformation of data 
between these CAD systems is crucial to the success of the design project.  
Due to the lack of standard-interfaces, especially in 3D Systems, an 
automatical transfer of data was not possible.  With the CADRAN system it 
is now possible to transfer data from one CAD system to another without the 
loss of information, even if both systems do not have the same 
functionality and complexity.  The core of CADRAN is a knowledge -based 
system written in PROLOG.  It incorporates transformation rules how to 
represent objects in various CAD systems.

<Program>	CAS/FPS - Computer-Aided  Synthesis  of  Flexible Production 
Scheduling.
<Number> 	488
<Domain>	Production Planning  and  Scheduling  of  Multiproduct  (Batch) 
Plants.
<Purpose>	Multicriteria  design  and  control  of  flexible  
multiproduct
(batch) plants by computer-aided synthesis of the production plans and 
schedules from the possible building elements.
<Description>	In the traditional methods of  synthesizing  the  
multicriteria
suboptimal production plans and schedules, the possible  variants are 
represented by the partial structures of a previously defined 
superstructure. The problem size is limited by the  combinatorial 
explosion accompanying the  heuristically  controlled  systematic 
search. Exact optimization is generally addressed  using  various 
methods of the operational research. The multicriteria situations 
should  be  described  by  a  single  aggregated  goal  function,
supplemented by optional limiting constraints.
     In the PROLOG  represented  structural  models  the  various 
solutions are synthesized from  the  "free"  active  and  passive 
elements of the structural model. The memory requirement and  the 
combinatorial complexity can be reduced by the use of prototypes, 
describing "blank" activities and variable  or  virtual  storage.
The multicriteria evaluation can be carried  out  without  any  a
priori  aggregation  or  ranking  of  the  individual  goals  and
constraints. A set of flexibly modifiable suboptimal variants can be 
synthesized and the subjective human  decisions  can  also  be taken 
into consideration.
     The structural models are described by dynamically  declared clauses 
determining the activities and storage, while the various tasks are 
executed by  the  general  kernel  definitions  of  the metainterpreter 
operating above these databases.  The  activities and storage functions can 
be created, modified and deleted either through  a  user-friendly  
interface  or  by  the  support  of  a full-screen editor. The core 
definitions can be  supplemented  by the user-defined includes.

formalism is similar to PATR-II, in which linguistic information is 
represented by sets of attribute-value pairs, in positive, negative, 
disjunctive, or implicative relation.  Translations are defined as 
tree-to-tree transductions.  As a development tool, it includes means 
for loading and unloading grammars, reading/writing 
texts/translations from/to terminal or file, creating linguistic 
objects as well as displaying,
deleting, storing, retrieving and comparing them.  Grammars have been 
written for English, German, French, Spanish, with experimental versions 
for Russian, Greek, and Japanese.

<Program>	CATS/DIANA
<Number> 	230
<Domain>	Electronic diagnosis
<Purpose>	diagnosis of analog electronic circuits
<Description>	The system uses model based diagnosis, in which a 
model of the correct behaviour of different components of the system 
using a structural description of the system is compared with 
observations. Any conflicts between these two can be analysed, 
without needing explicit lists of possible faults.
CATS is a general conflict recognition program designed for 
continuous dynamic systems: values of physical quantities are 
represented by interval arrays to take into account both dynamic 
aspects and uncertainty. 
DIANA is the application to analog electronic circuits, providing a 
library of models of electronic components, an incremental 
description interface and a connection to CATS entry points.
Conclusive industrial experiments have been carried out on hybrid 
(digital/analog) boards and on the electric power subsystem of a satellite.

<Program>	CELLBUILDER.  It comprises several programs, the main one of

<Number> 	482
<Domain>	Communications
<Purpose>	To generate optimal cell layouts for the cell library of the 
Crosspoint CP20K family of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), starting 
from a transistor- or gate-level schematic.
<Description>	Of me, or the program?
<Developed by>	Howard A. Landman
One translator program was written by John McDonald.
<Organization>	At time of program development: Crosspoint 
Solutions, Inc.
Currently: HaL Computer Systems, Inc.
<Country>	USA
<Prolog system>	Initial feasibility testing was done using public domain 
Prolog on an IBM PC.  When the limits of this systems were reached, I 
switched to CProlog on a SPARCstation.
ÇIF*** The text replacing this argument is too long ***È<Other 
languages>	Somewhat over half the system was written in Perl.  The 
cellmapper program is structured as an "oracle machine", with a Perl 
top level communicating with a Prolog "oracle" through a pair of 
pipes.  This was a nice mix of languages: The fabulous I/O and text 
processing capabilities of Perl allowed me to ignore the rather lame 
I/O of Prolog to a large extent and focus the Prolog engine entirely 
on search problems.  Meanwhile, Perl took care of all the file 
munging, text
formatting, error handling, etc.

This division of labor not only enforced a clear modular structure, but had 
the minor advantage that on a multiprocessor, the Perl portion and the 
Prolog portion could run on different processors.  This gives a speedup 
which ranges from negligible (for large cells with few solutions, which are 
compute-bound in Prolog) to perhaps 25% (for small cells with many 
solutions, which exercise the Perl portion more).
<Lines>	A couple thousand each of hand-coded Perl and Prolog, plus a 
fair amount of Prolog "facts" which were generated automatically by Perl 
scripts from various databases.

moment.  I may try to write this up for publication soon.

<Program>	Conceptual Graph Editor (CGE)
<Number> 	417
<Domain>	Knowledge Representation.
<Purpose>	To easily edit and build conceptual graph knowledge bases.
<Description>	CGE is a graphical interface to the Conceptual 
Graph Tools (see the CGT entry) for X Windows environments.

Multiple windows may be opened on the same graph
database. Each window is an editor which uses
simultaneously the graphical and linear notation. CGE makes use of 
the mouse, menus, buttons, dialog boxes,
etc. to provide the user *only* with the operations
supported by CGT, which are higher-level than primitive
operations like "draw an arrow". As such, at any given
time, the displayed graphs are canonical (in the sense of
Sowa's theory). CGE can be considered to be a "syntax-oriented" 
editor. 

CGE uses the Graph Widget which is responsible for the
actual display of the graphs. CGE only works with X
Prolog which provides declarative access to the X Windows
Toolkit through the Widget Description Language (widget =
window gadget; X Windows terminology for "graphical
object").

<Program>	Conceptual Graph Tools (CGT)
<Number> 	416
<Domain>	Knowledge Representation.
<Purpose>	to have a partial implementation of Sowa's Conceptual 
Structures.
<Description>	As Sowa puts it, Conceptual Structures "are a 
system of
logic with a graph based formalism that aims for a very wide 
expressive power.  Its primary purpose is to serve as an intermediate 
language between natural language and other
formalisms including database query languages [...] and
predicate calculus."

CGT includes predicates to implement the most important
operations on conceptual graphs, like the canonical
formation rules and the propositional inference rules. CGT
reads and writes conceptual graphs using their linear
notation. It also provides facilities to manipulate graph
databases. A sample one comes with CGT.

<Program>	Coronary Network reconstruction
<Number> 	237

<Purpose>	3-D reconstruction and labelling of coronary networks from X-
ray projections
<Description>	The program reconstructs a three-dimensional image 
of coronary networks from two simultaneous X-Ray projections. The 
procedures in the reconstruction-labelling process deal with the 
correction of distortion, the detection of centre-lines and 
boundaries, the derivation of 2-D branch segments whose extremities 
are branching, crossing or end points and the 3-D reconstruction and 
display.
All algorithmic components of the reconstruction were written in the C 
language, whereas the model and resolution processes were represented by 
predicates and production rules in Prolog. The user interface, which 
includes a main panel with associtated control items, was developed using 
Carmen, the Prolog by BIM user interface generator.

<Program>	CPPRO
<Number> 	478
<Domain>	Test Engineering - diagnosis and repair recommendation of 
faulty PBX circuit boards.
<Purpose>	Circuit Board Diagnostic Troubleshooter Tool.
<Description>	CPPRO allows a circuit board test engineer to 
graphically
build a diagnostic tree composed of nodes and arcs to aid in the 
diagnosis and repair of PBX circuit boards.  Nodes of the tree 
specify diagnostic tasks a technician must perform on the board when 
it is plugged into a troubleshooting test set.  Nodes also contain 
automatic messages sent to the test set to exercise board circuitry.
Leaf nodes contain recommended board repair actions. Arcs emanating from 
nodes are labelled with possible answers to the questions asked at the 
nodes. When used by the technician, CPPRO executes the diagnostic tree, 
asking questions of the technician, specifying probe actions, graphically 
displaying valid scope traces and component and pin locations on the 
circuit board, and making repair action recommendations.

<Purpose>	A tool for symbolic verification of digital circuits
<Description>	The Circuit Verification Environment is a tool 
which applies symbolic techniques to the verification of a digital

reliable and much faster than conventional simulators. The 
verification procedure realised by CVE computes the output behaviour 
of a digital circuit as boolean functions of the inputs. Sequential 
circuits are treated as finite automata.
At present CVE can handle ASICs with up to several tens of thousands 
of cells - typical for the functional blocks in today's ASICs, or up 
to approximately 15,000 transistors in full custom circuits.
CVE includes a compiler for EDIF netlists and for the CN format of SIGRAPH-
EL as well as several cell library descriptions.

<Program>	DAMOCLES - Damage Monitoring and Control Expert System.
<Number> 	329
<Domain>	Damage control, fire-fighting, stability and buoyancy.
<Purpose>	Damocles is supposed to aid a damage control officer aboard a 
Standard frigate of the Royal Netherlands Navy.
<Description>	TNO Physics and Electronics Laboratory, in collaboration 
with the NBCD School of the Royal Netherlands Navy, has developed Damocles, 
a Damage Monitoring and Control Expert System.  The main purpose of the 
Damocles project has been the development of a prototype expert system 
which supports the damage control (DC) officer aboard Standard frigates in 
maintaining the operational availability of the vessel by safeguarding it 
and its crew from the effects of weopons, collisions, extreme weather 
conditions and other calamities.  Basically DC-management includes the 
classical command and control cycle:  status maintenance, situation 
assessment, planning, tasking and evaluation.  An important way of making 
the total DC-organisation more effective is to improve the quality of the 
decisionmaking process by providing automated decision aids to the DC-
officer in addition to the information processing and presentation 
facilities already available.  This applies especially to damage assessment 
and planning.

<Program>	DART
<Number> 	7
<Domain>	Analysis of concurrent programs
<Purpose>	To facilitate the deadlock analysis of concurrent programs.
<Description>	Concurrent programs often have a huge number of 
states; a fact that makes their analysis extremely difficult and 
sometimes impossible. DART is a system that has been developed in 
order to reduce the effort required for a specific analysis problem; 
namely deadlock detection. The system transforms the concurrent 
program into a Petri net model and uses techniques from Petri net 
theory to reduce the size of the model. The new model of the initial 
program; contains the same deadlock information but has substantially 
less states. DART has been
implemented in Prolog and has been used to efficiently analyze programs 
that have several millions of states

<Program>	DedChem
<Number> 	84
<Domain>	Organic chemistry
<Purpose>	Synthesis planning based on name reactions in organic chemistry
<Description>	In organic chemistry, syntheses need to be planned 
carefully prior to being performed. A synthesis plan contains all the 
information that is needed to synthesize a given substance, i.e. the 
reactions involved, the order in which the individual reactions are 
to be performed, the intermediate substances which are synthesized as 
by-products, etc.
DedChem is a system for synthesis planning in organic chemistry. In 
DedChem, a deduction component implemented in Prolog computes 
synthesis plans from name reactions and substance classes stored in 
external databases. DedChem differs from other synthesis planning 
systems in two important respects:
- it is based on name reactions instead of concrete reactions, and
- it is designed as a coupled system which accesses a variety of 
external relational or higher databases.
DedChem is designed to be able to access a variety of external 
databases for practical and legal reasons.
The current version of DedChem features a graphical user interface, a 
simple synthesis tree browser, and user-friendly access to the reactions, 
substance class and superclass databases.

PROGRAM
<Number> 	325
<Domain>	Pension Fund Variation.
<Purpose>	Selection and Definition of Pension Benefits.
<Description>	The PROLOG module interacts with an end-user to select 
benefits applicable for a category of members.  The benefits are defined by 
selecting and assigning values to a set of parameters based on information 
obtained by user interaction.  The resulting benefit structure is written 
to an Information database.  The PROLOG knowledge base is structured around 
a benefit classification tree  (frames).  The knowledge interpreter is a 
standard frames/rules inference engine with an extra layer of domain 
specific functionality added.

<Purpose>	Diagnostic system to provide early detection of errors in

<Description>	The Diagnostic Expert System is used to provide 
early detection of errors because of the complexity of the diagnostic 
problem and the need to capture the expertise of highly experienced 
troubleshooters. It is built using Lirov and Yue's Semantic Control 
Paradigm and consists of identifier, goal selector and adaptor 
modules. The test engineer specifies the signal path, failure 
probabilities and test costs using the identifier. The goal selector 
derives the optimal diagnostic/replacement tree. Finally the adaptor 
traverses the diagnostic tree and recommends the measurements or 
replaces accordingly.
A color display is used to highlight errors of missing or failing parts of 
a signal path.

<Program>	DESA - Desassembler of VSLI circuits
<Number> 	418
<Domain>	CAD of VLSI circuits.
<Purpose>	Structural abstraction of VLSI.  This circuit 
desassembler is fully written in prolog  and  it  is part  of  a set 
of programs that perform the abstraction and the
verification of the VLSI circuits.
<Description>	CAD verification tools employed in BULL make use of  
an  abstraction process that extracts the structural and functional 
specifications of a design from its layout level. A VHDL description 
can be obtained at the ending stage of the process.

The recognition of all the basic parts of the design such as  
inverters, switches, nand, nor, latches, and others is provided.  
Management  of  the  great  diversity  of  models  is   accuratly 
done   thanks to an independent base of models.

All the basic cells to be recognized are depicted in the  models. The  
syntax  of these models is the one of prolog and the mechanisms of 
recognition are closely linked to the  prolog  mechanisms of 
unification and resolution.

Models can be recursive and are applied on sequence until saturation 
on the transistor netlist.                

The validity of this approach has been proved  as  realistic  and the  
program has been employed for several years on real projects in the 
company. An efficient  control  of the recognition process allows very 
large quantities of data to be  easily processed.

<Program>	Detect5.pro
<Number> 	54
<Domain>	Natural language processing
<Purpose>	Didactic tool for second-language teaching
<Description>	Detect.pro is an error detector and corrector of 
badly formed natural language sentences that are entered by a user in 
French. The parser is a top-down implementation of Definite Clause 
Grammar (DCG) rules. It can identify errors of three types: order of 
words, agreement errors and ambiguities. When the parser has detected 
an error, it sends an error message and provides a correction for 
that error. In the case of ambiguous sentences, the system gives all 
possible meanings of that sentence. It also gives the syntactic 
structure of the sentence (in parenthetic form), as well as its 
optional tree representation.

In second language learning, the student must not only find out where he 
made a mistake, but he must also understand why he made that mistake.

<Program>	DFT Spectral Analysis.
<Number> 	467
<Domain>	Digital Signal Processing Analysis and Simulation.
<Purpose>	Compute Power Spectral Density of Complex Sequences.
<Description>	This program demonstrates the utility and 
expressive power
of the Prolog language for digital signal processing analysis and 
simulation. At its present state, the program  accepts a list of complex 
numbers (list of dotted pairs) and produces its power spectral density for 
a specified number of frequency points.  Underlying the implementation is a 
short, clear, and efficient recursive form of the  Radix-2 FFT that 
implicitly incorporates correct ordering of the spectral output.  Of 
significance is the fact that this Prolog system supports numerical 
computation efficiently  not only via is/2, but also by means of real and 
complex scalar and vector primitives. In fact, the efficiency of this 
program ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 compared to C, depending on how the 
arithmetic is implemented.

<Description>	Calculation of employees gross pay and allowances 
is in many industries the most difficult and error-prone part of 
payroll calculation. In large organisations with employees engaged in 
diverse activities many different "payroll rules" (i.e. award 
Conditions) may be in use. There is also 
considerable scope for individual interpretation of the meaning of 
the conditions specified in various awards. The DynaPay Awards 
Interpreter enables an infinite number of sets of Award Rules to be 
specified; each set is allocated to one or more employees, The system 
takes as input each 
employees daily starting and ending times (optionally gathered 
directly from a time clock) and calculated for each employee all 
necessary ordinary, overtime and penalty payments together with any 
allowances and leave payments 
which may be required producing an explanation of the "Reasoning" used in 
the payroll calculations.

<Number> 	212
<Domain>	Power generation
<Purpose>	Real-time centralised control and maintenance of hydro-electric 
power plants
<Description>	Remote power plant data is measured by 
microcomputers and local transdusers and transmitted to the control 
room and stored in an Oracle database. The expert sytem continuously 
analyses any changes in these parameters and decides on changes to be 
made to the settings at the power plants. The instructions are then 
formulated and sent to the power plants via a remote data link.
The system also allows the operator to monitor the state of the power 
plants at all times and to use mimetic diagrams to monitor changes in 
parameters, or to formulate and send instructions directly.
Due to the system, power plants which were for the most part left unused in 
winter can be operated continuously at all times, and their operation 
optimized at other times.

<Number> 	468
<Domain>	Automated Theorem Proving, Cooperative Interfaces for 
Knowledge-Based Systems.
<Purpose>	 Natural Deduction Automatic Theorem Prover for Knowledge-Based 
Systems with an Explanations-Generating Cooperative User Interface.
<Description>	A complete and consistent automatic theorem prover 
for classical logic. Designed to be the inference module for 
knowledge-based systems which use classical logic as the language for 
domain description. It produces Natural
Deduction proofs in the Normal form that can be translated to natural 
language explanations of the inferences. The prover is designed to 
produce direct proofs (easier to understand, since they do not use 
contradiction) whenever possible. 
When the prover is unable to reach a conclusion, because of lack of 
information it allows the identification of the pieces of information that 
may complete the proof, enabling the system to complete proofs by directing 
questions to the user, or to the world in the case of autonomous systems.

<Purpose>	Assist in building single equation econometric models.
<Description>	EMEX is intended to assist someone with a good 
qualitative knowledge of a market to build a quantitative model of that 
market.  It supplies the model building expertise; the user indicates the 
basic structure of the market and supplies historical data. The system is 
composed of a Prolog program that interacts with the user, and which then 
issues commands to, and interprets results from, a FORTRAN statistics 
package.  The user is thus shielded from the complexities of the model 
building process.  The resulting model is used to quantify the relationship 
between factors operating in the market; eg. a 1% rise in price will reduce 
sales by 2%, or  an advertising campaign produced a 2% increase in sales. 
It can also be used for making forecasts of future behaviour.

<Program>	EMICAT
<Number> 	55
<Domain>	CASE Tool
<Purpose>	KBS development environment
<Description>	EMICAT is an object-oriented language extensionof 
prolog for the acquisition of complex knowledgeusing mechanisms such 
as frames, inheritance, demons and production rules. 
In addition EMICAT facilitates the way this knowledge is used thanks 
to the original methods of applying rules and mechanisms of 
hypothetical reasoning such as state memorisation.
EMICAT is used not only to develop expert systems or to generate 
them, but also to develop "conventional" programs while taking 
advantage of the object representation facilities. EMICAT is used 
both for prototyping and for implementation of operational systems.
EMICAT is sufficiently integrated within Prolog that all the advantages of 
logic programming can be used. It is a basic software program that has been 
marketed as such, and has brought the cost of developing KBS in industry 
down considerably.

automatically detecting certain faults, but proposing better 
optimized alternatives. It uses a set of declarative rules written by 
experts ina pseudo natural syntax, thus allow very easy maintenance.
 In 1990, ESFA was used over 4,000 times in practice, detected 20,000 
serious errors and proposed 140,000 alternative optimizations.

is based on about 100 pages of European regulations and it is 
designed in order to help the administrative staff of the Belgian 
Ministry of Economic Affairs in filling in forms and performing other 
related operations.

EUREX knowledge base is composed of rules written in a specific language; 
documented in a dictionary and compiled into pure Prolog. EUREX is front-
ended by various powerful tools including a window-based user interface; 
tracing and explanation facilities. Moreover; a knowledge editor allows to 
update the rule base as well as the dictionary and thus to extend EUREX to 
other regulations.

<Program>	EXPOD
<Number> 	315
<Domain>	Chemical Design.
<Purpose>	EXPOD is an Expert System for Polymer Design.
<Description>	The development of a new , custom-designed polymer 
is a laborious and time-consuming task.  It involves extensive 
research by means of ccessing the literature and by experimentation.  
EXPOD is an expert-system conceived specifically for polymer 
scientists designing linear homopolymers.  It was created with two 
objectives in mind:
 
1.  Increased efficiency in polymer design.
     EXPOD's primary function is to predict the fundamental 
properties of a polymer from its molecular structure.  Using the 
optional reverse-inference module, it is also possible to generate a 
polymer structure from a set of required properties.

 2.  Smooth management of polymer data.
        EXPOD comes with a knowledge base containing rules for the 
prediction of basic properties.  It's database contains 80,000 items 
covering over 2,400 known polymers.  Yet EXPOD has been designed as an 
open-ended, user-extendible system; both the knowledge base and the 
database may be edited and augmented.

<Program>	FAIRCHILD prototyping system
<Number> 	201
<Domain>	Electronics design
<Purpose>	Rapid prototyping of chip design
<Description>	This system consists of a number of independent 
programs built in a phased manner to prototype aspects of the design 
of a high-performance microprocessor known as the Clipper Chip. 
A prototype timing analysis program was written to analyze timing and 
identify conflicts or bottlenecks. A custom ROM assembler was developed to 
improve efficiency of developing microcoded instructions. A design 
simulator was written to analyze alternative designs for the instruction 
pipeline capabilities of the Clipper chip. A test vector generator was 
developed to test floating point instructions to conform with IEEE 
standards.

<Program>	Fantasy Basketball
<Number> 	47
<Domain>	Sports statistics
<Purpose>	Maintains Routisserie/Fantasy Basketball leagues; keeps weekly 
NBA statistics in a Prolog database; ranks NBA players and teams.   
<Description>	Fantasy (or Rotissiere) Basketball leagues are a 
growing hobby among avid basketball fans.  These leagues consist of 
made-up teams whose players are in the NBA; and features competitions 
between teams based on the actual stats of their NBA players.  The 
primary job of this program is to download the weekly NBA stats; 
convert them into a Prolog clause database; and compute the weekly 
standings for teams in the league.  The resulting NBA statistics 
database is also used to rank NBA players on a variety of statistics 
to predict future performance.  Prolog has been an excellent vehicle 
for this program due to its built-in support for databases; sorting; 
and parsing.
This program has been used to produce the weekly standings for the Bay Area 
Fantasy Basketball League for two years.

<Program>	FRENCHIP
<Number> 	220
<Domain>	Electronic design
<Purpose>	synthesis of logic circuits
<Description>	The designer uses a very high-level definition 
(VHDL) language to construct the project. The design approach is top-
down using hierarchical block diagrams. The designer can intervene to 
modify options or supply parameters in the course of the synthesizing 
process. The high level of abstraction of the VHDL models allow the 
designer to focus on the design and validation of the function and on 
any other aspect which he judges critical. This also leads to 
increased productivity and control of time and costs. In addition the 
system includes rewriting rules at the same high level so that VHDL 
can be extended.
More than 70 projects have been developed, mostly in the range 30-60 
thousand gates, but some with more than 100,000.

<Program>	FuPlan
<Number> 	504
<Domain>	Engineering of Automated Building Management Systems.
<Purpose>	CAE . System for Configuration of Control System.
<Description>	In a building management system, a substation is 
one 
fundamental component. A substation enables processes to be Directly 
Digitally Controlled ( DDC ) by means of its Controlling Program, 
which must be configured and parameterized for different 
applications. The configuration 
is represented as a Command List in a special language. FuPlan fills 
the gap between the plant schematic and this list. One module is for 
drawing functional diagrams, which are automatically compoled to the 
Command List. Other modules 
permit management of projects, installations, substations, plant 
devices, sheets,signals, function modules, terminals and macros. The 
inherent relationships between these objects are guaranteed to be 
consistent: some dependencies, e.g. form substation type, are partly 
data-driven. Soem data 
may be extracted form plant schematics drawn by an other CAE-System. 
Documentation of various aspects may be printed. Input facilities, semi - 
graphics and data-structure give high efficiency in interaction, time and 
space.

<Number> 	85
<Domain>	database front-end, system integration
<Purpose>	Provides a high-level general data access abstraction
mechanism using a client - server architecture for access to
diverse sources of data and knowledge.
<Description>	An access mechanism for either a Prolog program or 
a C program that provides a data abstraction service layer.  External 
data access and interpretation are encapsulated in the conceptual 
views and meta data of the Generalized Query Server.  The "core" 
Generalized Query System software provides a query language and 
network access layers so that application developers can access any 
of the encapsulated data sources.  Data from flat files, databases, 
object-oriented databases or even expert systems can be encapsulated.  
The query language makes the physical data access mechanisms and 
network layers transparent.
The query language is much like Prolog, but has a number of additional 
features such as second order logic, abstract data types and object-
oriented syntax.

<Program>	geons
<Number> 	65
<Domain>	Computer vision
<Purpose>	To recognise the class of a 3-D volumetric primitive object in 
an image description which consists of curve properties and relations.
<Description>	In an area of computer vision research, classes of 
volumetric primitives are used as a kind of 'alphabet' in the 
recognition of complex 3-D objects. Two-dimensional images of 3-D 
volumetric primitives are 'input' in the form of facts about curves, 
lines and their properties and relationships (e.g. curved/straight, 
connectivity).
This information could in principle be derived automatically from a 
grey-level image.  The logic program models, in a qualitative way, 
(a) the 3-D objects, (b) the model-scene projection relationships, 
and (c)the image structure.
These declarative models constitute a 'parser' for the input curve data 
which is analysed by the program to recognise the appropriate category of 
geometric primitive.

<Program>	GESER
<Number> 	211
<Domain>	Ship design
<Purpose>	To check that a ship design satisfies all applicable 
regulations
<Description>	200 pages of regulations are encoded into the 
system, which enables a person using the expert system to check a 
ship's design in a few minutes, after entering the necessary data 
which takes less than half a day. This compares with four to five 
days for an expert for each manual verification, which has to be 
performed several times during a design. Due to the exhaustive nature 
of its knowledge bases, GESER avoids errors that could otherwise have 
dramatic consequences if discovered at a later stage.
The system also has capabilities to help experts translate new 
regulations into the knowledge base. It can handle "meta-knowledge" 
such as "except if rule 1.A.34 applies..." and can handle bilingual 
(French and English) knowledge bases.

<Program>	GEX-Tool 
<Number> 	97
<Domain>	electronic assembly
<Purpose>	an environment for developing large diagnostic expert systems
<Description>	Graphical Expert System Creation Tool presents a full 
colour graphic display of a circuit pack, highlighting suspected 
components, asking for additional information and suggesting replacements. 
GEX-Tool handles both single and multiple faults and will trouble-shoot 
multiple circuit packs simultaneously. GEX-Tool is a true expert system 
using three kinds of knowledge to diagnose circuit problems:    (1) 
experiential heuristics    (2) general purpose tactics and troubleshooting 
techniques    (3) connectivity model based reasoning GEX-Tool consists of 
four modules: automatic rule generation, manual rule editing, rule 
compilation and a rule exception and operator interface module. The first 
module takes files describing component and circuit topology and also 
replacement and testing costs and prepares data for the second module which 
allows an engineer to edit and optimise the diagnostic procedures. The 
third module generates rules in the C language which are then compiled to 
form the knowledge base used by the shop operator. This cycle can be 
repeated as often as necessary to deal with changing conditions. Most 
expert systems are notoriously slow, but GEX-Tool uses proprietary 
compilation techniques to deliver remarkable performance while it supports 
one of the largest, most complex knowledge bases of any industrial expert 
system.

<Program>	GOLDFINDER
<Number> 	296
<Domain>	Geology
<Purpose>	To advise an exploration geologist on the best location to site 
a drill hole to find gold.
<Description>	Goldfinder is a knowledge-based system which assesses the 
potential of a gold prospect and gives advice on the best locality to site 
a drill hole.  The geologist's map of the prospect is the primary source of 
input data.  Knowledge is stored partly as semantic networks but mainly in 
a production rule formalism.  By interaction with the user the system 
establishes a dynamic database containing, at a sophisticated level, 
information about the main lithologies, the nature of any mineralisation or 
alteration, and the structural features of the prospect.  Using a method of 
intersecting loci, the system locates a drill site with a precision 
governed only by the scale of the map.

<Purpose>	A tool for development of grammars by linguists.
<Description>	The Grammar Development Tool (GDT) is a tool for
development, test, and translation (into Prolog) of grammars. It is a 
multilingual tool for development of both analysis and generation 
grammars for different languages. Linguists use this tool to develop 
the grammars in grammar
formalisms and then automatically translate them  into a DCG format or 
Prolog. Users of the tool can view the grammar rules, change existing 
rules, and add new rules. Grammars can be tested by running test examples 
one at a time, or in batch. GDT also allows tracing of the grammar rule 
applications for debugging purposes.

<Domain>	Electronic design; data modelling
<Purpose>	Provide a graphical front end to internal ECAD design tools
<Description>	This project consists of a series of workstation based 
tools that display and analyize the output of internal VLSI design tools; 
many of which reside on mainframes.  At this point Prolog is used as a 
rapid prototyping language with a high level X interface.  Since design 
needs and technology change quickly; this is a major feature of the 
project. The first tool that is near release displays clock tree 
connectivity and computes the steiner net wiring. Design data is modelled 
using frames; some of the interface is modelled with graphical objects. 
Future work may incorporate simple constraints and rules.

<Program>	GraphicKnowledge
<Number> 	479
<Domain>	Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

<Purpose>	Extract structure from unstructured graphic files
(e.g., "un-WYSIWYG" a 2-d line map).
<Description>	 GraphicKnowledge provides a framework for 
extracting
structure from unstructured graphic files.  The problem is similar to 
that of restructuring a document into SGML or similar mark-up, given 
only the output typeset form of the document (that is, we are "un-
WYSIWYG"ing the files).  In the case of the graphic files, we have 
lines, pieces of text, and symbols ("cells").  Based on contextual 
information, we reconstruct these into objects (e.g., a street with 
the associated name, block, and connectivity to other streets).  The 
first version of this program is being used to restructure
the City of Edmonton's water maps (1700 maps, containing
300,000 objects).  The cost of the automated conversion will be about 1/3 
of the cost using conventional techniques and will reduce elapsed time from 
2 years to about 6 months (including programming and quality checking).

<Program>	 GROG - General Recognition Of Gates in VLSI circuits
<Number> 	419
<Domain>	CAD of VLSI circuits.
<Purpose>	Structural and Functional abstraction of VLSI. The prototype of 
this expert system is built upon Prolog. It performs the hierarchical 
abstraction of full custom VLSI circuits.
<Description>	CAD verification tools employed in BULL make use of  
an  abstraction process that extracts the structural and functional 
specifications of a design from its layout level.
As the company has gained a great experience in VLSI abstraction, the 
main goal of this new  project is  to give  the users all the power,  
the  ease  of use and the maintainability of a rule-based expert 
system.
In former applications the circuit models could  only  be  
implemented by specialized PROLOG programmers.          Now the 
syntax of the rules has been made so that it can be easily  employed  
by non programmers.
Abstraction is mainly based upon the trial and  error  resolution of  
hypotheses.  Such  a  mechanism is therefore locally provided within 
the premise part of each production rule. Action part of rules leads  
to  the  classification  of  all  the recognized  parts  of  circuits  
(usual  classes  are  inverters, switches, latches, registers, ...).              
Backward and forward chaining allow to control  the  hierarchical 
abstraction of the circuits that made up the VLSI. Abstraction of 
complex parts of design  such  as  registers,  adders,  ram,  can 
therefore be easily provided.
Today, the validity of such an approach has been proved as feasible on real 
subsets of design. Full  developpement  may  be  considered.

<Description>	Operating system extensions have been designed to give 
the equivalent of the interprocess communication as possible under UNIX or 
OS/2 to MS-DOS computers running in parallel.  The present system uses 
serial ports for communication and is based on a ring topology.  The system 
is designed to be used for parallel computation of genetic pedigree 
analysis (see the entry GRONLINK).  Two applications are foreseen:  one to 
use spare capacity of networked MS-DOS machines running under OS/2, and one 
to build a parallel computer from single board PCs.

<Purpose>	Optimizing a roster of Doctors in a hospital.

<Description>	A roster of hospital doctors was scheduled as a generate

doctors (about 20) is asked for his preferences for weekdays and weekend 
days as prefers, can do and cannot do.  First the prefers then the can and 
finally the notcannot slots are filled.  If more than one person is a 
candidate for a slot at a given preference level, then a probabilistic 
conflict resolution scheme is used.  Constraints are applied early:  number 
of free days between duty periods, balanced number of weekend and weekdays 
for each person and no duty allocation on cannot do days.  If the roster is 
not successfully completed (a rare occurrence) after say N attempts, then 
the constraints are relaxed by the program until a solution is found.  The 
program outputs:  The complete roster, individual letters and statistics 
including an individual"index of satisfaction".

<Purpose>	Automatic conversion of the IF/PROLOG programming manual into 
hypertext.
<Description>	The program converts the input data-a programming manual-
into Hypertext.  Starting with files prepared for output on a Kyocera laser 
printer (this allows wysiwyg browsing) the first two passes of the program 
system reconstruct the objects (words, lines,boxes etc.) on each page and 
recognise headlines, tables and normal paragraphs based on formal criteria 
such as typical words or fonts.  In the next step a sophisticated algorithm 
reduces the words to their stems and weights them by significance.  Only 
sufficiently important terms are finally used to create links between their 
referencing and defining occurrences between paragraphs related to a common 
topic.

<Purpose>	Correlation of faults detected by built-in test equipment in 
the sensor, weapon and command system on the Dutch Multipurpose-frigate.
<Description>	INDICAID is able to correlate BITE detected faults.  It 
will provide all possible explanations in terms of sub-systems, ordered 
according to likelyhood.  Knowledge acquisition can be done in run-time, 
that is, the system learns from experiences.  However, the knowledge 
representation is very structured, and model-based diagnosis like 
algorithms are used.  The programme contains facilities to test and monitor 
three different types of system modelling.  Based on the results it will be 
possible to select the best of these in an operational version.

<Program>	Infologics Faultfinder System
<Number> 	90
<Domain>	Service Engineering
<Purpose>	
<Description>	FaultFinder is a diagnostic tool which combines expert 
systems and multimedia techniques to enhance the productivity of service 
engineers. It provides on-line assistance in the form of a knowledge base 
which helps the service engineer in diagnosis and maintenance. This is 
backed up by a Knowledge Management System which is used by product 
specialists in creating and maintaining the knowledge bases. The product is 
a domain oriented tool, not a general purpose expert system shell. 
FaultFinder incorporates both fundamental and heuristic knowledge which 
Infologics says are both important when troubleshooting technical 
equipment. Fundamental knowledge is typically that provided by the 
manufacturers, including design features, test procedures, etc. Heuristic 
knowledge is based on rule of thumb, usually gained from years of hands-on 
experience. FaultFinder knowledge bases can be located at the support 
centre, in field service or at the repair shop. The support centre is 
normally the first contact between a customer and the organisation. 
FaultFinder can be used here to diagnose faults and, if the job is to be 
handed to a field engineer, pass on information about appropriate spare 
parts and tools. Repair shops typically have several service engineers 
maintaining a broad range of products.

<Purpose>	On-line electronic corporate phone book.
<Description>	IPHONE is an interactive program which exploits the
database, non-determinism and pattern-matching capabilities of Prolog 
to allow telephone operators to query a corporate phone book. The 
phone book information, including the addresses, departments, and 
managers of employees are stored as Prolog terms. Queries on any of 
the
fields are supported allowing regular-expressions and fuzzy matches. The 
application is built with a client-server application so that a single 
(large) program has complete control over the data-base, while light-weight 
menu programs provide an interface for users. Updates are supported through 
a priviledged version of the user interface.

<Program>	ISCN Expert
<Number> 	87
<Domain>	Health
<Purpose>	Interpret chromosomal abnormalities
<Description>	The expert system allows geneticists to better reference 
and interpret chromosomal abnormalities such as those which result in Down 
Syndrome, mental retardation or physical disabilities. It interprets the 
International Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature, which is the standard 
notation used to represent human chromosomal abnormalities. These 
notations, each representing a person's genetic layout, are maintained in a 
computerized registry for reference and comparison against each other. 
Inconsistencies may arise, however, because each chromosomal variation can 
be written in a number of formats and thus be difficult to retrieve from 
the registry.

<Description>	Kalipsos is a shell system that converts French 
texts into  Sowa's Conceptual Graph model. 

It includes a morphological analyzer containing 40,000 lemmas which 
can recognize all the inflected forms in a French disctionary; a 
syntactic botoom-up analyzer which applies a context sensitive 
grammar of about 350 rules; a semantic analyzer which generates 
conceptual graphs for sentences using the syntactic trees and the 
semantic lexicon describing the meanings of words, including defaults 
for unrecognized words.

There is also an information retrieval and deduction component which 
applies expert system rules to interpret the conceptual graphs when simple 
pattern matching is not enough. Finally there is a natural language 
generation component for answers.

<Purpose>	To analyse the structure of large (Ada) software systems.
<Description>	Information about the structure of a software 
system
is obtained from an Oracle database. This information
is manipulated to form various graph structures. There are a number 
of views based on these graphs that a software
analyst can use to determine more information about
the software, thereby assisting them to locate potential
"hot-spots" in the code. Queries can be made to highlight
packages with certain properties and trial
modifications to the software structure can be made.
The information can help the analyst determine
suitable changes to the structure of the system to eliminate
the hot-spots.

<Purpose>	Minimization of costs of transporting and placing grain.
<Description>	Before and during the harvest; planners in grainfirms 
have to minimize the cost of transporting and placing different types of 
grain. The grain can be placed in a number of different locations; with a 
lot of restrictions on placement.  The "KORNPLAN" program helps the planner 
optimize placement by calculating a suggested placement of the total amount 
of grain. As the problem is P-complete this suggestion is not the best 
conceivable solution; but the planner can interact with the program  and 
reach a satisfactory solution. The plan can be evaluated in a number of 
ways; including a graphical representation of transports.

<Program>	LES - Laboratory Expert System
<Number> 	88
<Domain>	Biomedical Research
<Purpose>	Expert System for Designing PC Boards
<Description>	Rockefeller University's Biomedical Research Laboratory 
produces "Labmaster", a PC board designed for biomedical research. 
Labmaster monitors outside data and converts electronic signals to digital 
signals that the computer can read. The specific configuration of of the PC 
board required for a given experiment varies depending on the research and 
types of data required. Determining an apropriate board for the experiment 
can be a time-consuming and error-prone task. To minimize the time and cost 
involved, Arity Prolog was used to develop the Laboratory Expert System 
(LES). A research technician utilizing LES simply inputs the criteria for a 
given experiment. LES, run on a PC, then analyses the requirements and 
generates a list of possible board designs that meet the criteria.

<Description>	LOGICLANDIA is a Prolog shell to create, edit and 
query simple databases, which represent a formalisation of a given 
problem in terms of classes of objects and relations among them. The 
language used to interact with the software is  a formal language, 
which includes the logical connectives (and, or, not, implies) and 
the logical quantifiers (existential and universal). LOGICLANDIA also
includes a facility that translates into Italian the student
formalisation of a query, to facilitate the students  understanding 
of their mistakes. LOGICLANDIA's user interface is implemented in C 
language.
LOGICLANDIA  belongs to a courseware aiming at  promoting the learning of 
propositional and predicate logic through a problem oriented approach. 
Besides the software, the courseware includes a student workbook, teacher's 
notes and assessment material. The courseware has been field tested in 
Italian schools.

<Program>	LOPSTER (LOgic Programming with SubTypes and Extended 
Resolution)
<Number> 	370
<Domain>	Used as declarative language for general purposes like 
PRO
LOG itself.
<Purpose>	Compiler for the order-sorted logical language LOPSTER 
which is an extension of the KA-Prolog compiler.
<Description>	 LOPSTER is an extension of PROLOG by order-sorted 
resolution.  The main benefits offered by sort-restricted deduction 
are shorter programs and hence smaller search spaces (part of the 
deduction  is effected during unification) and built-in inheritance 
mechanisms. In order to implement dynamic typing the LOPSTER compiler 
generates extended WAM code which can manage the order-sorted 
unification on runtime. If possible, the compiler tries to simplify 
statically the greatest lower bound operation on the sort lattice.  
By an extension and modification of a given Prolog compiler it was 
possible to implement the compiler very quickly. The numbers below 
are refering to the whole in KA-Prolog written compiler. The 
indications in brackets are describing that part of the compiler, 
which makes the additional functionality of 
the LOPSTER compiler available in relation to the original (insource  code 
given) Prolog compiler.

<Program>	MacCLINT
<Number> 	18
<Domain>	Machine Learning; Inductive Logic Programming 
<Purpose>	Interactive Concept-Learning; Theory Revision; Belief Updating
<Description>	MacCLINT is a user-friendly interactive concept-
learner and theory revisor that combines several interesting 
features: it constructs most of its own examples; uses knowledge; 
handles integrity constraints; performs abduction; shifts its bias; 
postpones examples and converges to knowledge bases in the limit. 
This unique combination of features makes MacCLINT significantly 
differe
nt from other approachess in Inductive Logic Programming. MacCLINT 
contributes to the removal of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck; can be 
used for intensional knowledge base updating and as a module for learning 
apprentices.

<Description>	An assembly constraint language based on linear time 
temporal logic of Manna and Pneuli. The temporal operators are implemented 
as logic predicates so that any temporal formulae, asserting the acquired 
assembly constraints, can be directly coded as a logic program of the 
respective predicates. Auxiliary predicates are implemented to verify or 
synthesize all assembly sequences that satisfy the logic program of 
assembly constraints.

Construction using Component-Based Building Systems.
<Purpose>	The MPCP is a Blackboard System based on the Edinburgh BBS. It 
is used to maintain a 3D solid model of a building for intelligent design 
purposes.
<Description>	The MPCP underpins a collection of computer-aided 
building design programs which have been written to use components from a 
well defined set of construction elements. The MPCP maintains the 3D model 
of the building and filters out changes which will cause problems if the 
building is ever constructed. It also looks for a given set of problems 
such as clashing components, typically "silly" architectural details, and 
so on. It flags the problem and generally has a few good ideas about what 
to do about it.

<Program>	Mathias
<Number> 	49
<Domain>	Mathematics
<Purpose>	Animation of Discrete Mathematics
<Description>	Rules for Discrete Maths: to generate combinatoric 
objects like sets and set operations; partitions of integers (sets; 
sequences; bags); sub collections of sets; sequences and bags; 
vectors and matrices; cartesian products of various kinds; functions 
(total/partial; into/onto; oneone; manyone) and relations and 
operations on them (closure; domain restriction; etc);polynomial 
manipulation(not much); some useful system-independent input/output 
rules and higher order rules for rules which have an infinite number 
of solutions(count; sigma; memoization; while; reduce); standardizes 
arithmetic functions (eg mod and div on negative integers; floor; 
ceiling; power function; factorial;gcd; random numbers).
Works on a set of about 25 foundation rules called "underware" (for 
easy portability) and provides a prolog-system-independent way of 
writing standard Prolog with fixed meaning and guaranteed built-in 
predicates.  Uses built-in predicates where available and renames 
them for portability. Takes about half to 1 day to port the underware 
then the whole of Mathias runs identically on any system. Includes 
complete on-line help (with key words) and on-line Manual of about 90 
pages (generated by the system). Has been used on Safety Critical 
systems and to animate Z specifications and network protocols; object 
oriented set theory.
  On top of the basic Mathias system described here; there are other 
modules in preparation.

<Program>	Medical Expert Diagnostic System
<Number> 	96
<Domain>	Medical - GP
<Purpose>	
<Description>	The Imperial Cancer Research Foundation developed this 
system in association with the Oxford University Press to investigate the 
feasability of providing a fully fledged medical expert diagnostic system 
for experimental deployment in the surgeries of GPs. The system was 
originally implemented in Prolog on a workstation but reimplemented on a PC 
using Quintec Prolog using a database of medical knowledge and rules of 
inference supplied by experts. The delivered system was able to provide a 
rapid and comprehensive response to aid in the the GP's own process of 
diagnosis, verification and elimination. The two phases took approximately 
one person year, but the developers estimate it would take two months to 
repeat the work. The system has been evaluated at several UK and European 
sites and the methodology is now being developed in an oncology project 
which includes facilities for the recommendation of effective treatment and 
drug therapy.

<Program>	MISTRAL
<Number> 	474
<Domain>	Dam safety.
<Purpose>	Filtering, intepretation and explanation of alarms coming from 
automatic monitoring systems of dams.
<Description>	MISTRAL is an expert system for evaluating, 
explaining and filtering alarms generated by automatic monitoring 
systems of dams.
MISTRAL belongs to a family of systems developed within the project 
DAMSAFE for managing dam safety.  The aims of MISTRAL are to provide 
on-line interpretation of the behaviour of a dam and to reduce the 
requests of expert intervention.  MISTRAL uses geometrical and 
physical knowledge, heuristic and engineering judgement based on 
experience. It deals with significance and reliability of the  
instruments to assess the safety of the dam. The result of the 
evaluation is the definition of the state of the dam and its main 
components, and the identification of the physical processes going 
on.  An explanation of the state of each component and
process is generated.
Both the evaluator and the explainer are written in Prolog, while the 
communication mechanisms with the monitoring system and the interface 
manager are external.

<Program>	MMI2
<Number> 	38
<Domain>	Multimodal interfaces / Expert systems
<Purpose>	Multimodal interface for man machine interaction with knowledge 
based systems
<Description>	The project aims at making considerable advances in 
the domain of interface technology by offering users a wide range of 
interaction facilities within the same interface system:different 
communication modes are integrated up to a point where the user can 
mix modes in the course of a single interaction;an advanced dialogue 
manager controls the interaction process; making decisions as to 
user/system 
initiative; appropriate response mode; context driven interpretation; 
etc.;user modelling facilities provide an appropriate range of 
interactions relative to the user's level of competence.

The demonstration domain for the interface is computer network 
design. An expert system is built offering both design and technical 
and commercial analysis functionalities. The result is a cooperative; 
multi-modal dialogue between system and user.

The MMI2 system is a highly modularly built interface system and is 
destined to be portable to other kinds of knowledge based applications.

<Program>	MODGEN 2.0-model generator for chemical processes.
<Number> 	484
<Domain>	Dynamic Simulation.
<Purpose>	Dynamic simulation of chemical engineering process units  
by  a discrete  structural  model,  generated  automatically   in   
the
knowledge  of  the   user-defined   decomposition   pattern   and 
prototypes. 
<Description>	MODGEN represents a completely  new  approach  in  
the  dynamic simulation of process units in chemical engineering.  
Using  this tool, instead  of  the  many-fold  transformation  of  
the  model through the mathematical construct and the  numerical  
algorithm, the process unit is automatically decomposed into  an  
executable Prolog program. Starting from the knowledge of  the  user-
defined decomposition pattern and  from  the  actual  prototypes  of  
the physical and chemical changes, the respective balance element and
elementary transitions are algorithmically generated in the form of 
properly classified and ranked PROLOG clauses. The calculation itself is 
simply carried out by the consecutive execution of  the ranked elementary 
transitions. The user can communicate with  the system either through a 
user-friendly interface or  directly  via the generating database. The core 
definitions of  the  generating and executing metainterpreter can be  
supplemented  by  the  user defined prototypes of the given field.

<Program>	MODGEN/DMS Dynamic Modular Simulation of Technological  
Systems.
<Number> 	491
<Domain>	Dynamic Simulation of Technological Plants.
<Purpose>	Dynamic simulation of  complex  technological  plants  using  a 
dynamic  modular  technique  comprising  the  quasi-parallel   or parallel 
execution of the  generated  structural  models  of  the process units.
<Description>	In  the  conventional  methods   used   for   the   
simulation
(flowsheeting) of a process containing recycle loops an iterative 
calculation is applied. In the enhanced methods  instead  of  the 
direct parameter estimation a  two-level  calculating  scheme  is 
used, where the upper level linear model calculates  the  streams 
from the estimated efficiency factors, next the individual models 
determine the new proposition for the efficiency parameters.
     In the Dynamic Modular Simulation this complicated procedure is 
replaced by a completely new method.  The  simulation  of  the 
individual process units is solved by the MODGEN model  generator 
that makes possible:
-tthe modeling of each unit with the same algorithm, and
-tthe step-by-step saving of the data  determining  the  temporal 
state of the models.
     The simulation is controlled by the supervisory module  that in 
the knowledge of the appropriate generating  databases  starts the  
generation  of  the  structural  models  and  organizes  the 
communication between them. Then the calculation is  carried  out 
quasi-simultaneously or effectively  in-parallel,  while  between the 
time steps the processes  communicate  with  each  other  vis 
messages.
     The  method  can  also  be  executed   in   a   conventional
monoprocessor machine, however, using a  multiputer  machine  the whole 
system can the simulated simultaneously.

<Program>	MODGEN/HPLC -  Modeling  Preparative  High  Performance  Liquid 
Chromatography.
<Number> 	490
<Domain>	Simulation of Preparative HPLC.
<Purpose>	 Dynamic simulation of preparative HPLC (High Performance 
Liquid Chromatography) columns  by  an  automatically  generated  PROLOG 
structural model. 
<Description>	The traditional modeling  technique  of  the  High  
Performance Liquid Chromatography columns needs the solution of a  
system  of second order partial differential equations containing  
nonlinear inhomogeneous functions  and  associated  with  rather  
difficult initial and boundary  conditions.  In  addition,  in  
preparative regime   the   columns   are   often   overloaded,   
consequently
discontinuities are formed and passed along the column.
     Using the model generator, the process unit is automatically 
decomposed into the structure of the primitive  balance  elements and 
elementary transitions  existing  between  them.  The  actual problem 
can be defined by the composition of the liquid,  by  the components 
to be adsorbed, as well as by the  parameters  of  the approximate 
multicomponent equilibrium function. The process unit is described by 
its geometrical data, by the  characteristics  of
the adsorbent and by the process parameters including the  liquid 
flow rate,  the  mixing  characteristics,  etc.  The  calculation 
itself is simply carried out by the consecutive execution of  the 
generated elementary transitions.
The generated structural model can  advantageously  be  used
for the simulation of the various regimes of the column including change of 
the solvent and/or the flow direction.  The  robustness of the method makes 
possible its use  for  the  modeling  of  the special techniques (e.g. 
displacement chromatography, etc.).

<Description>	MULTI accepts a DCG-like grammar specification for 
a language and produces a parser and a generator for that language. 
These parser/generators can be built statically (as YACC does) for 
separate compilation, or constructed ``on-the-fly'' in programs which 
are language-independent, but need to load a language front-, and 
back-end at run time. When used with PLEX (Lex for Prolog) the 
MULTI/PLEX system provides an environment
in which a single language description acts as a source-file
for a complete system of tokenizing/parsing/generating software.
MULTI/PLEX grammars have been developed for VHDL, Verilog, Motive, 
Synopsys, and AT&T's FPDL language.

<Domain>	Communications.
<Purpose>	Electronic Mail Interface.
<Description>	Augmented interface useable for both Cyrillic and 
Roman Characters.  Introduces mechanisms to dynamically configure 
email groups as a system function.  Interface categorizes mail 
according to date/(source/destination)/subject, is highly visual, and 
requires minimal computer knowledge and keystrokes:  DOS and UNIX 
interfaces indistinguishable.  File transfer and data management 
facilities integral to the interface.
Communications between DOS and UNIX provided via a fault-tolerant 
streaming protocol across modem or RS232/422 terminal link.  
Dedicated user shell provided for call-ins from DOS machines.
Fully asyncronous email system minimizes hardware investment, and off-loads

<Program>	Network Management
<Number> 	95
<Domain>	Retail network management
<Purpose>	
<Description>	A sophisticated technology demonstrator for a retail 
network management system. The system which makes extensive use of graphics 
and object-oriented programming to model a network of point-of-sale retail 
terminals interrogated by a central controller. The network information can 
be altered graphically by the operator Ñ by clicking and dragging nodes and 
filling in forms. Previous polling activity can be simulated by 'playing' a 
log of polling events against the network which then uses colour to reflect 
the changing status. The user-interface is further enhanced by the novel 
use of video cassette recorder-style icons to control the event log play 
back.

<Program>	Opium
<Number> 	2
<Domain>	CASE tool
<Purpose>	An automated and extensible debugger for Prolog
<Description>	Opium is the preliminary result of a research project on 
automated debugging.  The aim is to have Prolog programs help to debug 
other Prolog programs. The debugging strategies are primiraly based on 
trace analysis.  Opium consists of a kernel which provides a handful of 
debugging primitives; connecting the debugged and debugging Prolog 
processes. Those primitives are partly implemented in C.  On top of the 
kernel a number of extensions have been built; for example to automate the 
debugging of non-terminating or failing programs. An extension handler 
(fully implemented in Prolog) ensures that all extensions have a consistent 
user interface and an up-to-date documentation. Prolog is the command 
language of the tracer; together with the tracing primitives this provides 
a query language which is more general and user-friendly than the usual 
programmable conditional breakpoints.

<Program>	Optimist
<Number> 	60
<Domain>	Oil exploration
<Purpose>	To assist geologists in oil exploration
<Description>	    The Optimist system was developed at the Turing 
Institute to assist geologists in assessing the probability of 
finding oil at prospective sites. Reasoning in this domain is 
characterised by the existence of different arguments for different 
conclusions, and experts frequently disagree. Unlike typical domains 
where expert systems have been developed, there is no single, agreed 
on, provably correct answer about the likelihood of finding oil.

 To assist experts in appraising oil likelihood, Optimist maintains 
separate models of experts' opinions stored both as rules and as 
records of specific oil prospect appraisals. The system and user 
`argue' to interactively assess a new prospect, Optimist assisting 
the  expert by arguing for consistency with previous decisions of 
this and other users. The importance of these approaches - 
personalised knowledge and an `argumentative' style of interaction - 
lie in the system's ability to  construct, faithfully remember and 
replay models of expert's reasoning and to highlight previous 
relevant appraisals the expert may be unaware of.

The system has been in commercial use for over two years.

information from text sources, knowledge bases or patient database. 
Graphical display and ineraction capabilities (diagrams, images, 
numerical plots, body charts) are under development. 
The current knowledge base is only a fragment of the eventual 
requirement for general practice, being about 16,000 facts covering 
joint pain, nausea, vomiting and breathlessness. Assuming a full 
knowledge base of around 10 million facts, a storage requirement of 
200MB is indicated.
The system also incorporates the compact disk version of the Oxford 
Textbook of Medecine, a 300-author general medical reference work, 
and uses its indexes to retrieve text.
Other aspects include decision support, case reporting, patient notes and 
the Bordeaux Oncology Support System.

processes.  Besides a wide scale of SIMULA 67-like process interaction - 
communication instructions resource handling is also available.  The 
implementation tool of the system is not PROLOG but on its user level it 
behaves as if it was written in PROLOG taking the style of problem 
description (set of clauses) and its back -tracking mechanism into 
consideration.  The system is implemented in a hierarchical way.  The first 
implementation level is a list processing language and this is implemented 
presently in FORTH but we plan to change FORTH for C or C++.  Due to this 
second implementation level PCUBE is able to actually control the users 
process system according to the time-table found.  The system is available 
on IBM XT/AT.

<Purpose>	a declarative debugging system for a subset of Prolog
<Description>	Program faults are divided into three classes: incorrect 
solutions, missing (uncovered) solutions and non-termination. For each of 
these different algorithms are provided which will generally pinpoint the 
clause in error, with varying efficiency, by use of an oracle (the user) 
who knows the status of ground instances of all intended relations. The 
system is limited to ground queries in pure Prolog.

<Domain>	Pharmaceutical research
<Purpose>	Calculation of parameters predicting biological activity for 
peptides
<Description>	The system generates a family of structure activity 
models and at the same time facilitates prediction of the biological 
activity on the basis of these models.It infers chemical structure 
units (substructures, fragments) from the aminoacid (i.e., chemical) 
composition of peptides and assigns numerical parameters to the 
relevant units. This is done by Prolog programs. The relationship 
between the parameters and the biological activities of peptides
is obtained by running Fortran programs.

<Purpose>	Home budgeting program.
<Description>	PERSONAL  CASHFLOW  applies modern  business 
techniques to the  serious business of managing your own money 
including:
- preparing regular financial statements.
- preparing budgets and measuring your actual performance against 
them.
- analysing your cash flow.
- forecasting and planning for the future.

To  make  it  easy to use,  it  has  the familiar look and  feel  of  
a spreadsheet. It is not however just like any spreadsheet. It's a 
set of "hot-linked"  or  integrated spreadsheets  and data screens - 
when  you make  an  entry  in  CASHFLOW  it ripples instantly through  
all  these
spreadsheets to update them.                             

PERSONAL CASHFLOW does not apply artificial intelligence as such but 
is a good example of how a high level language like PDC Prolog can be 
used to produce a succesfull retail programme.

PERSONAL  CASHFLOW for the PC costs just 69 pounds sterling or 5 pounds for 
a demo disk.

<Program>	Personal Notekeeper
<Number> 	361
<Domain>	Intelligent Text-retrieval for multilingual Documents; Secure 
Electronic Notebook.
<Purpose>	Integrated, intelligent, multilingual, Fulltext Database 
for 
documents up to 64 KB, providing enhanced security features as high-speed 
encryption and access control. Specially suited for sensitive text's and 
notes on laptop's.
<Description>	Personal Notekeeper is an intelligent text-
retrieval system 
designed as an "easy-to-use" electronic Notebook that handles an 
almost unlimited number of documents with sizes up to 64KB. Each 
database can optionally be locked with different access-control 
levels, and specific privileges can be granted for as many users 
desired. Additional mechanisms can be "armed" in order to protect a 
DB from unauthorized "break-in attempts". Each document in a DB can 
be encrypted with a new and efficient encryption method, making 
sensitive information virtually unaccessible to unauthorized persons. 
Documents can be read from disk and/or edited in the integrated 
editor. Each
document has its own "Title-Sheet", where a title and additional 
information has to be specified. This way the documents can be classified 
and logically grouped like in a conventional database. An optional 
Expiration-Date enables the program to automatically remove "expired" 
documents in order to prevent the DB from growing unnecessary. With the 
complex search capabilities of Personal Notekeeper it is possible to 
quickly find any requested document or set of documents. Multilingual 
searches with automatic keyword translation between the five major EEC 
languages (English, German, French, Spanish and Italian) make finding of 
foreign language documents easy. Also documents with Synonyms of searched 
keywords will be found, if requested.

<Program>	PHARGEST.
<Number> 	75
<Domain>	inventory management (drugs), decision support
<Purpose>	Management of the central medical store of the Tchadian 
Public
Health services (inventories, orders, deliveries, follow-up of
consumption).
<Description>	PHARGEST offers all the usual facilities of a 
classical inventory management system (commodities database, 
inventory control, orders, deliveries, clients and suppliers follow-
up, and so on)maybe with some special features.
1. It is centered around the "batch" defined as "drug+expiry date". 
Prevention of wastage by exceedind expiry dates is one of the 
objective of the system.
2. It is multi-stock: because different development agencies 
contributes to the funding of the Central Medical Store, it was 
necessary to adopt a "multi-stock" management system without 
networking facilities (the Tchad is one of the less-developped 
country in the world).
3. Due to the fact that each funding agency has its own management 
rules, PHARGEST has to provide for very different management systems, 
specially with regard to deliveries.
4. Because some managers are in charge of the distribution of drugs 
to all the public health services of a large area, the follow-up of 
comsumption of these services and the evaluation of their needs is 
one of the main function of the program.
5. It provides unusual facilities for helping the manager to estimate his 
future needs (inventory extrapolation) and take account of his financial 
constraints.

<Purpose>	Exercises for translating English sentences into truth-

<Description>	PHILO is a standalone program which interacts with 
students as they try to give the logical analysis of English examples 
of truth-functional sentences.  The program reads back an English 
rendition of the student's attempt and checks whether it is logically 
equivalent to the instructor's answer; it does this
even if the student's answer is wildly different syntactically.  If the 
student's answer is not logically equivalent, a case is given in English 
where the student's answer differs from that of the instructor.  A record 
of errors is kept for the instructor to examine; a separate program, DUMP, 
prints these out in an informative way.  Exercise examples reside in a 
separate ASCII file which the instructor can alter using an editor or 
wordprocessor.

<Program>	Pictorial Janus
<Number> 	16
<Domain>	Program Visualization
<Purpose>	Provide a visual programming environment for
concurrent logic (and more generally constraint) programming
<Description>	Pictorial Janus is a visual programming environment being 
built to support concurrent constraint (or logic) programming.  A visual 
syntax for Janus; a concurrent constraint programming language; has been 
designed.  Currently; two modules of Pictorial Janus are operational: a 
parser and an animator.  Visual programs can be created using nearly any 
illustration or CAD tool capable of producing a Postscript description of 
the drawing.  That description is executed by a Postscript interpreter; and 
a trace of the strokes and text drawn is saved to a file.  The Pictorial 
Janus parser then interprets the trace and produces input to the Pictorial 
Janus Animator.  The animator generates a stream of animation frames and 
associated sounds.  The colors; shape; fonts; line weights; used in the 
original drawing are preserved so that the animation displays these 
elements in the same graphical terms as they were conceived and created.

<Program>	PigE
<Number> 	43
<Domain>	 farm management.
<Purpose>	An expert system for optimising the growth of pigs raised 
in
pig pens.
<Description>	PigE is an intelligent back-end to a 
mathematicalmodelling package called AUSPIG. The model:
** simulates the growth and reproduction of pigs;
** identifies factors that limit optimal performance of the pig;
** identifies management strategies that maximise enterprise profit.
The expert system:
** presents an abstracted description of the output of the model in a
form that a non-mathematician can understand;
** suggests dietary; housing; genotype; or resource input changes 
that can improve the profitability of the herd.

Verification studies have demonstrated that the expert system can
significantly out-perform human experts interpreting the output of the 
model (performance measured in dollars per square metre per day).  In a 
usual case; the improvement is of the order of 10%.  If spread over the 300 
kilotonne $500 million dollar (per annum) Australian pig herds;this 
improvement would be in the order of $50 million.

<Program>	PLANE:  PLANIFICATION EVOLUTION
<Number> 	322
<Domain>	Scheduling.
<Purpose>	Gives Schedule and load of the long term production of 
aircraft.
<Description>	The aim of the PLANE system is to pace the assembly 
lines, under a given set of constraints, so as to minimize combination of 
the stock costs and of the production rate changes.  The system takes into 
account most of the planning expert's usual work (his choice of heuristics, 
his planning and factory parameters, his planning method).  The average 
scale of the problem is to plan 250 planes over five years, in a factory 
using 8 assembly lines.  These numbers are taken from the data of the 
Mirage 2000 being used to test the system.  The PLANE system uses the 
constraints in the finite domains (integer numbers), one of the three 
constraints domains handled by the CHIP language.

<Program>	Planning (more than) one-level buildings
<Number> 	274
<Domain>	Architecture, Planning
<Purpose>	Supports the planning process of a building with more than one 
level.
<Description>	The system provides support in the stages of planning 
with more than one level. First it generates the variants of ground-plans 
of all flats according to the special requirements of customers. The 
customer is given the possibility to classify the variants, to choose the 
most advantageous ones, and to exclude the less favourable ones. The 
program assembles from chosen variants the plan of the whole building 
satisfying requirements for the horizontal and vertical arrangements, the 
given measurements, and the conditions depending on the building site.

<Program>	PLASMA
<Number> 	312
<Domain>	Re-Engineering.
<Purpose>	PLASMA is a reverse CASE tool to maintain large COBOL programs.
<Description>	PLASMA Targets the market of existing large scale 
COBOL programs which have been in productive use for years but have 
to be maintained anyway, for example to accomodate legal changes or 
new services.
Maintenance cost eats up more than 60% of the software cost over the 
lifecycle of large scale commercial software.
PLASMA reduces this maintenance cost by
1.  Analysing one or more COBOL programs and their interrelation.
2.  Visualizing the analysis result.
3.  Supporting software maintenance activities.
 
Application Areas:
1.  Software maintenance support.
2.  Job operation optimization support.
3.  Condition analysis during construction of data dictionaries.

<Program>	PLASYNT
<Number> 	64
<Domain>	Combinational logic synthesis
<Purpose>	Multiple-level combinational logic synthesis
<Description>	PLASYNT starts from a description of a 
combinational circuit, specified in Berkeley PLA format.  Internally, 
the descriptions are stored and manipulated in a directed acyclic 
graphs representation known as BDD.

The program includes algorithms for  finding optimal variable orderings in 
the BDDs, for assigning don't care values, for factoring Boolean functions 
to decrease the area of the circuits, and for mapping descriptions to 
specific technologies.  PLASYNT currently maps descriptions to two 
different technologies: (i) networks of NAND-gates and inverters, and (ii) 
gates from Plessey's gate library.

<Program>	PLEX
<Number> 	455
<Domain>	Software Development.
<Purpose>	LEX for Prolog: A lexical analyzer generator for Prolog.
<Description>	PLEX creates a tokenizer from a lexical 
specification very
much like that for the UNIX(TM) LEX program. The major differences are that 
the right-hand (action) parts of the lexical rules are Prolog goals, the 
source-code output by PLEX is Prolog, and because of the dynamic nature of 
the Prolog environment, lexical analyzers can be built ``on-the-fly'' and 
used immediately.  That is, there is no need for intermediate compilation 
steps as when using LEX.  Together with MULTI, this program provides a 
complete environment for building parsers and generators from a single 
very-high-level specification.

<Program>	PPLC 2.0 -  flexible  process  control  by  Prolog  
represented
higher order Petri-nets .
<Number> 	485
<Domain>	Process Control.
<Purpose>	 Process  control  of  single  units  or  small  chemical   
and
biotechnological plants by a structure-based  model,  integrating the 
batch, sequential, feedforward and feedback control actions.
<Description>	 PPLC integrates the pseudo-parallel executing 
abilities of  the
Petri-like  nets  with  the   possibilities   provided   by   the
prototyping and unification characteristics of  the  PROLOG.  The 
continuous and/or batch control algorithms  are  described  by  a 
structural model consisting of active and passive  elements.  The 
passive elements are reserved places for  the  various  kinds  of 
control  information,  while  the   active   elements   are   the 
transitions determining the essential skeleton of the information 
processing. The architecture of the structural models is  similar to 
the higher order Petri-nets, however,  instead  of  tokens  or 
tuples, optional PROLOG terms can be associated with the  passive
elements and these terms are manipulated as information. The main executing 
rule of the kernel  algorithm  describes  that  if  all input signs and 
auxiliary conditions for a given  transition  are fulfilled, then the 
active element after an optional  time  delay fires, i.e. the prescribed 
output  signs  are  rewritten  in  the respective places. The structural 
model of the control is defined by a dynamic database or by  dynamic  
partitions  of  the  PROLOG.  The software  is  built  up  from  four  
shells  of  the user-friendly interface,  the  directly  editable  
database,  the actual includes and the kernel definitions, respectively.

<Program>	Practitioner Awards KBS
<Number> 	191
<Domain>	Pensions administration
<Purpose>	
<Description>	The system calculates retirement benefits for 
medical and dental practitioners employed by National Health Service. 
Conventionally this is a long and tedious task because the procedures 
used for assessment are defined by a large volume of ever changing 
legislation.
  Sets of practitioners records can be selected and downloaded from a 
mainframe to a 'master PC', and then distributed to other PCs over a LAN. A 
Prolog program converts incoming records to a frame-based representation 
prior to distribution. Each of the slave PCs contains a local copy of the 
Knowledge-based system which is used to maintain the content and accuracy 
of the mainframe data, generate graphical displays of the member's service 
history, calculate benefits and print out the results and appropriate 
documentation.

<Program>	PRESS 
<Number> 	77
<Domain>	Programming Language Interpreters
<Purpose>	(PRolog Execution of Standard Semantics) 
(1) To check and validate the informal semantics of draft standard 
Prolog, and
(2) To investigate techniques of writing high quality maintainable
Prolog programs.
<Description>	The informal semantics of Prolog in the draft 
standard defines the control constructs (i.e. conjunction/2, 
disjunction/2, true/0, fail/0, call/1, cut/0, if-then/2, if-then-
else/3, catch/2, throw/1) using a stack model. The details are 
complex, and this interpreter has been written in order to check the 
description is correct.
The subsidiary aims of the interpreter have been met by providing
(1) checks that internal predicates are called with valid arguments, 
and
(2) a set of test cases whose results can be easily compared
with model results. This checks that changes to one part of the interpreter 
have not broken other parts.

<Program>	Prof'Expert
<Number> 	373
<Domain>	 Computer based training.
<Purpose>	The purpose of the system is to provide computer training in 
basic skills.
<Description>	The system is a hypertext which permits the learners to 
inform themselves about basic topics like French grammar, mathematics, etc. 
It is planned that the links between the information units adapt themselves 
auto-matically to the learner level. For some topics exercises of drill and 
practice are available. For these the teacher or the learner can select 
options like the presentation or the error admittance. They dispose of 
several help systems: How to obtain a solution or part of the answer etc. 
The learner and the teacher can examine and analyse the way that the 
problems were faced and solved. From a psychological point of view, the 
purpose of the system is to develop basic skills (automatisms) but with the 
possibility for the learner to examine his procedure and to develop 
metacognitiv capability. From an informatic point of view, the system is 
constitued of three generic expert systems. The first is the domain expert 
system (to perform calculus ....) the second is the didactical one. Its 
task is to establish the level of difficulty, classify the errors, etc. The 
third is the psychologist who should establish the learners profile.

is done across the following dimensions: structure, style, effectiveness 
and complexity. In case where quality errors are discovered in a program 
the system suggests correct alternatives. During the structural analysis 
the system reveals and prints (in the form of a hierarchy diagrams) the 
logical structure of the program being analysed, and records the structural 
corrections that are to be performed.

<Program>	Prolog-D-Linda
<Number> 	462
<Domain>	 Parallel Prolog Programming.
<Purpose>	To provide a Parallel Prolog Programming environment.
<Description>	Prolog-D-Linda (Prolog-Distributed-Linda) is an 
embedding of the Linda paradigm into SICStus Prolog. (Linda is a 
coordination language that is injected into existing programming 
languages to produce new parallel programming languages. Linda 
permits cooperation between 
parallel processes by controlling access to a shared tuple space.)  
Prolog-D-Linda supports a distributed tuple space, unification and 
Prolog style deduction in the tuple space, and a control hierarchy 
that provides remote I/O facilities for client processes.

The Prolog-D-Linda embedding of Linda in Prolog is very natural : the 
pattern matching and database features of Prolog have been used 
directly in the embedding; garbage collection and hashing in the 
tuple space are provided free by the Prolog implementation; the 
implementation of formals in tuples is direct; the way the tuple 
space is partitioned is specified by a 
Prolog program. The user controlled partitioning of the tuple space 
makes it possible to tune the use of the tuple space so that 
bottlenecks are avoided. The capability of deduction in the tuple 
space provides direct solutions to problems that were previously 
difficult or impossible. The remote I/O facility 
allows all client processes to be interactive.

<Program>	PROM
<Number> 	277
<Domain>	Systems Programming/ Computer architecture
<Purpose>	Mapping of INTEL 3000 Microprograms
<Description>	PROM performs  the task for address assignment for 
the INTEL 3000 microprocessor.
The PROM database can be thought of as a matrix of INTEL instructions with 
each instruction in the matrix indicating its successor(s). There is only a 
limited set of matrix positions for placing a successor (e.g. in the same 
column as the predecessor) that depends on the type of instruction. PROM's 
input consists of a set of partially loaded store and a microprogram to be 
allocated in the given store. The system gives either a possible mapping 
plan as output or indicates the impossibility of mapping the given 
microprogram.

<Program>	Prometheus
<Number> 	409
<Domain>	Expert Systems Toolkit.
<Purpose>	To provide a flexible tool for developing KBS.
<Description>	Prometheus is a general purpose expert system 
toolkit.
It provides a rich set of facilities for representing
knowledge, including backward and forward chaining rules,
frames and a procedural control language.  It supports
automatic truth maintenance and also provides object
oriented style message passing.  These underlying facilities are used to 
support the tools that make up the development environment, but its open 
architecture allows for the user to call out of or into the toolkit from 
Prolog.  This means the system can be easily extended or tuned by the user, 
or embedded in other Prolog applications.

be as full-fledged as some data-base systems, but has many features that 
you won't find in most commercial systems. Also, you may find it easier to 
set up and faster to use. PSI is useful for a broad range of data. Indexing 
with descriptors makes searching for the data you need fast, and the 
interface to other data-base formats (import and export) is quite powerful.

<Program>	PYTHON

<Purpose>	Expert system for recognizing and performing squeeze plays, an

<Description>	PYTHON is an expert system for recognizing and 
performing squeeze plays, an advanced strategy in the game of bridge. 
It performs, in its limited domain, at a truly expert standard, 
comparable to players of national ranking. The development of PYTHON 
illustrates how a well-constructed logical solution to a simple case 
of a problem can be extended in several different directions, 
yielding new results and a powerful program. PYTHON's core recognizes 
when a simple squeeze exists according to well-established theory. 
The core was extended to handle more complicated squeezes, also 
described by theory, making PYTHON's performance truly expert.
The core was also extended to generate a plan for playing squeezes which 
has been successfully executed by a separate bridge playing program. 
Finally, methods were added for recognizing and executing squeezes not 
covered by existing theory by analogy with the other methods.

<Purpose>	To compile RTA programs
<Description>	ABLE (Agent Behaviour LanguagE) is a parallel production 
rule language for developing multi-agent systems by explicitly representing 
the behaviour of the agents and  of the world in which they are situated.  
Real Time ABLE (RTA) is a high-performance subset of ABLE which executes at 
up to 20;000 events per second and is targeted; inter alia; to the Philips 
CD-I player.  The RTA compiler contains an ABLE interpreter which  expands 
the RTA source program into a set of variable-  free rules which are then 
compiled into a representation  of an asynchronous digital logic circuit.  
This circuit  is emulated in the application by a separate C-based  module 
called the RTA kernel.

<Program>	REKPERT PLUS (Rectification Knowledge based Expert System.
<Number> 	305
<Domain>	Chemical Engineering.
<Purpose>	REKPERT PLUS consists of several distributed cooperating expert 
systems to seperate multicomponant mixtures.
<Description>	For the implementation of an expert system for 
multicomponent rectification the technology of cooperating 
distributed problem solving is an adequate concept.
From an abstract point of view we differentiate between a manager 
expert system, several expert systems for special domains and service 
systems.  These systems (agents) communicate directly or via 
blackboard.
If a multicomponent mixture is to be seperated in pure components 
rectification could be an adequate operation.  The cooperating expert 
systems of REKPERT PLUS can be consulted to give an advice to 
separate the mixture economically.  The manager expert system of 
REKPERT PLUS decides which system is suitable to solve current 
subtasks.  The following special expert systems can be alternatively 
selected.
- REKPERT for usual columns and sidestreams.
_ TEAGPERT for special cases of the rectification like azeotropic or 
extractive distillation.
- SOLPERT choses suitable solvents.
- HEATPERT proposes heat integration possibilities.
-service systems with calculation methods and their applicability.
Alternative sequences, proposed by the system are ranked by the 
global knowledge of the manager system.
On the other hand in chemical engineering not only complex tasks arise, 
there are also isolated problems, e.g. if a company only needs a new 
solvent for their liquid withdrawals in a process.  So every expert system 
has to be able to operate in a process as a stand alone system and to 
cooperate with the other ones.

level. ACRI collates and consolidates the results (which arrive as ASCII 
files) on a mainframe system and offers comment and criticism to each bank, 
seen in the global picture. Rigen will now allow ACRI, centrally and 
without changing existing procedures, to regenerate the original Multiplan 
input worksheets and thus simulate alternative strategies to support their 
written comments. Rigen provides a friendly and secure front-end which 
ensures that the Multiplan worksheets it runs will not go wrong and produce 
unexpected, unintelligible, and out-of-context messages.

<Program>	ROADS 
<Number> 	51
<Domain>	Communication networks; private exchanges
<Purpose>	The term ROADS stands for Rule Oriented Application 
Design System. ROADS is a tool for rapid prototyping and simulation 
of applications based upon finite state machine principles.

<Description>	ROADS supports the following main features:
- Implementation of finite state machines by using SDL-like design 
principles combined with the advantages of applying a rule-oriented 
approach.
- Prototyping of user interfaces by using the available BIM-Prolog 
functions to support the XView Windowing System and the possibility 
to connect any type of device; such as PCs using MS-Windows or 
workstations using X-Windows
  or telephonic devices. In the latter case the implementation of the 
prototyped user interface can be reused within the final product 
without any constraint.
- A window-oriented user interface for interacting with the tool in 
order to develop an application.
- Support for generating documentation.
For ROADS the behavior of an application is modelled by a set of 
Finite States Machines (FSM) similar to the principles of the well 
known Specification and Description Language (SDL).

<Program>	RPROLOG - Re-evaluable Prolog .
<Number> 	487
<Domain>	Synthesis of Evolutionary Learning Algorithms.
<Purpose>	RPROLOG is a metainterpreter for the programming of the 
uncertain  possibilistic information feedback accompanying
evolutionary synthesis from genetic building blocks.
<Description>	The Re-evaluable PROLOG (RPROLOG) is  a  new  
approach  for the formalization of the possibilistic uncertain 
information feedback of the computer-aided synthesis. Using this 
metainterpreter,  the PROLOG s ability  for  the  determination  of  
the  all  possible solutions in principle remains, however instead of 
the systematic search, the successive variants tend to  satisfy  the  
previously
declared evaluating points of view. In the RPROLOG there are four 
kinds of predicates as follows: evaluated predicates,
evaluating predicates, re-evaluable predicates, and ordinary  
predicates.
The evaluated  clauses  may  have  multiple  solutions  that  are 
evaluated by one  or  more  aspects,  described  by  the  
relatedevaluating  clauses.  The re-evaluable  clauses   represent   
the significant part of the predicates playing role in the  proof  of 
the respective evaluated  clause.  The re-evaluable  clauses  are 
automatically supplemented by the various characteristics of  the 
value distribution functions of the solutions, deduced from them.
The connected ensemble of an evaluated predicate with the related 
evaluating  and re-evaluable  predicates  is  declared   by   the so-
called cybernetic modules. The evolutionary steps of  the  run are as 
follows:
-tHaving  selected  a  solution  for  an  evaluated  clause  the
  metainterpreter  evaluates  it  with  the  related   evaluating
  clauses.
-tNext  the  value  distribution  functions  of  the  prescribed
  re-evaluable clauses are modified by the new values.
-tFinally the re-valuable clauses  are  rearranged  according  to
  certain strategies.

<Program>	RTSC - Real Time Supervisory Control by structure-based  PROLOG 
program.
<Number> 	489
<Domain>	Real Time Supervisory Control and Database Management.
<Purpose>	Supervisory control of  a  flexible  multiproduct  batch  
plant
including supervision  of  a  PLC  and  a  six-channel periphery interface, 
as well as receipt interpreter  software  balance  and database 
manipulation.
<Description>	In  the  structure-based  supervisory  control  and  
real-time
database management the continuous and  discrete  activities  are 
represented by a unified  structural  model.  In  this  structure 
there are 9 types of passive elements including  reserved  places for 
the various kinds  of  Prolog  terms  referring  to  keyboard inputs, 
periphery  inputs,  periphery  outputs,  internal  hidden dynamic  
information,  internal  monitored  dynamic  information, problems 
activating  various  tasks,  database  inputs,  database outputs, 
printer outputs and screen outputs. There are 2 types of the active 
elements describing  the  rules  and  the  dynamically
called program modules of the individual problem  solving  tasks.
This architecture of the control model supports  the  in-parallel
execution that can be realized either by a concurrent operational 
system (e.g. CDOS) or by the  processes  of  a  CSPROLOG  program 
running in a multiputer machine.
     As an  example  in  a  flexible  multiproduct  plant  powder
mixtures for welding electrodes are produced  according  to  cca. 100 
receipts from 1-20 components stored in 28 silos.  There  are three  
feeding  lines  (weigh  hoppers  and  rope  crabs),   four automatic 
weighers, two manual balances, conveyor,  mixer  and  a drum filling 
station. The local control is performed by  a  FESTO PLC  (FPC-405),  
and  the  communication  is   supported   by   a six-channel 
periphery interface, both of them  connected  to  the
SICOMP PC via the serial ports. The  PROLOG  supervisory  program 
decomposes  the  actual  tasks,  coordinates  and  controls   the feeding, 
weighing, mixing  and  filling  processes,  updates  the software balance, 
accomplishes logging and performs the  database handling  functions  
(including  task   generation,   interactive database   manipulations,   
statistical   data   processing   and archivation).

<Domain>	Knowledge Representation
<Purpose>	Development and implementation of a new technology for 
creation of
expert systems in any field of symbol-numeric data processing by 
problem
analysem
analysts rather than professional programmers.
The technology main feature: the user composes a program from fielded
data examples (generalizing and building up some structure on them).
<Description>	The system contains menu service, editor, means for 
control over SAMPLE Interpreter options, tutorial and 20 demo 
programs. The SAMPLE language short description. Syntax is 
intentionally made trivial (only 4 key words). The only semantic 
concept: matching text abstractions (which may contain variables 
instead of abstracted fragments). Clauses and program performance are 
analogous to the Prolog ones. Link with Prolog is used for machine-
oriented objects and effects. The main feature of the language is the 
most possible similarity  of constructions for writing algorithms to 
the data being processed. SAMPLE may be considered as simplification 
of Prolog with special conventions and additional powerful 
possibilities for list matching, which are related to Refal, Snobol 
or Planner languages.

Uses: Linguistics: Check spelling (inflected languages as Finnish); 
Research Music: Generation and analysis of specific dodecaphonic series and 
tunes Mathematics: symbolic differentiation; logic formulas transformation; 
Education: demonstration of Logic Programming and other AI concepts in 
their simplest form. Aprobated with more than 50 program examples (with 2-
300 clauses SAMPLE source code sizes)

<Purpose>	
<Description>	Scheduling and Planning - Manufacturing Sector  A 
production line at a car manufacturing plant can accept a very large number 
of different model configurations. This flexibility means that the process 
of 'line balancing'. optimising the 'build' process of each car and 
supplying the line with skilled workers and materials is extremely complex. 
The basic rules of line balancing are already well known to skilled 
industrial engineers at the plant and had already been expressed by the 
customer's staff using Quintec-Prolog on a PC. Quintec Systems Ltd. was 
commissioned to provide and intuitive graphical system that allowed 
engineers to specify and manipulate a 'build precedence' network. A layered 
technique was employed so that the system could handle very detailed 
information without obscuring the network layout. The system was contructed 
using Quintec-Objects on a PC under Microsoft Windows and is currently 
undergoing trials at the plant. The manufacturer hopes to employ the system 
at their other plants in future.

<Program>	Scrivenerª - A Document Assembly Legal Expert System
<Number> 	89
<Domain>	Legal drafting
<Purpose>	an expert system based document assembly program
<Description>	To create a document for a user which is compatible 
with Word Perfect¨, Scrivener asks for necessary information to 
select and combine standardized sentences, paragraphs or other blocks 
of text, inserting the relevent names and other variable information 
into the selected text to create a customized document. It therefore 
reduces the time needed to prepare common forms of document and the 
possibility of errors in choosing among numerous standardized 
provisions. 
Scrivener offers the following features: ¥ The user is only asked necessary 
and relevant questions when assembling a document and can change any or all 
answers at any time and then see the document reassembled with the revised 
answers. ¥ Scrivener can display the model in outline form, with the 
conditions for including (or excluding) each clause, and provides pull-down 
menus and other development tools for quick and easy model editing.. ¥ 
Scrivener uses natural language names for variables and clauses with no 
artificial numbering or labelling and supports a variety of data types, 
including text, numbers, dates and multiple choice and a variety of data 
functions including arithmetic, string manipulation, date arithmetic and 
financial functions.  Dianoetic also offers a library of legal documents in 
model form, such as incorporation documents, leases, contracts, wills and 
trusts, for attorneys who wish to purchase and modify prewritten models.

<Program>	SD-Scicon Analyst System
<Number> 	91
<Domain>	Computer Aided Software Engineering
<Purpose>	provides a complete and automated support system for specifying 
project requirements
<Description>	 Analyst provides the software developer with a powerful 
tool for capturing a thorough specification of the project at different 
levels of abstraction the CORE methodology. It takes full advantage of the 
well-known user interface on the Apple Macintosh on which the system runs, 
and provides comprehensive graphics facilities using the full functionality 
of the Macintosh Toolbox. The high-level graphics programming features and 
window-style bit-mapped graphics combine to give Analyst the complete 'look 
and feel' of a standard Macintosh application. Other activities also 
related to the production of a requirements specification, such as 
documentation and diagrams, can be performed on the same Macintosh system. 
It is generally recognized that Prolog's strength is in the expression of 
logical relations and rules. SD therefore used Prolog for Analyst's rule 
checking subsystem. It is used to express the methodology rules and to 
store and retrieve application information. Pascal is used for handling 
user-interaction and interactive graphics in line with SD's normal policy.

<Number> 	74
<Domain>	Famine Prediction
<Purpose>	Help the team in charge of the Malian "Early Warning 
System"
(SAP:Systeme d'Alerte Precoce), to predict and assess the
nutritional status of the Malian population.
<Description>	Early Warning Systems aims at preventing the 
occurence of famines in sahelian coutries, such as experienced in 
1973-1974 and 1984. With the technical support of AEDES, the malian 
EWS collect all through the year agricultural and economical 
indicators about harvest, prices and availability of crops on 
markets; cattle and so on, and also more behavioral indicators 
related to migrations, changing of food habits...about some 200 
administratives areas of the North Mali.
SEAP is an information system acting first as a database manager for the 
stockage and restitution of all these indicators and secondly as a kind of 
expert system for their interpretation. By the confrontation of these 
conjonctural indicators with structural data about each of the 
administrative sectors, and with production rules, it produces early in the 
year a prognostic about the future nutritional status of the population and 
at the end of the year an end-state diagnostic. The outputs of the system 
help the technical team in formulating recommendations about food 
distribution and in orienting the collect of data.

<Number> 	371
<Domain>	Expert system, legislation on scholarships.
<Purpose>	 SEXSY is a tool to compute the composition and amount of 
governmental scholarships.
<Description>	 SEXSY is a data driven rule-based expert system 
with hypertext facilities. It's an event driven system with a text-
mode windowing user inter-face. It supplies the decentralised 
"Steunpunten" (information burea) of the
Ministry of Education and Science with a tool to answer complex 
questions of students about the amount and composition (gift, loan) 
of their governmental
scholarship they may expect, given their personal situation. SEXSY 
consists of about 100 rules which apply on about 1500 facts. The user 
interfaces consists of multiple "forms" in resizeable and moveable 
windows. In these
forms the user may specify the situation of the student. SEXSY 
applies the scholarship legislation to these facts and computes the 
scholarship the student may expect. The system will be extended with 
a hyperbase containing the
legislation, further regulations, and jurisprudence on scholarships.

<Program>	SIPS
<Number> 	159
<Domain>	CIM, QA, Education, Artificial Intelligence.
<Purpose>	Inductive Analysis:  A machine learning algorithm as an 
alternative statistical technique.
<Description>	The theoretical bases of this program are Quinlan's 
ID3-Induction Algorithn and Cendrowska's PRISM-algorithm.  ID3 
produces decision trees, PRISM produces modular rules.  Own research 
involved several aspects, such as dealing with real-typed variables, 
missing data, noisy data, contradictory data, finding a way to merge 
ID3 and PRISM, making the program output understandable for technical 
oriented persons and so on.
Development started as an exercise to learn how to write a program in 
Prolog.  Its further growth was driven by the R&D division of a steel 
cord multi-national , who collected huge amounts of data on the work 
floor as a first step towards CIM and -what is now called:  QA- and 
by R&D work at the depertment of Building Sciences at a University 
where one of the questions was how to distinguish experts from 
novices, and to find out what does expertise really mean, and how 
efficient the transfer of knowledge is in this domain.
In both domains mentioned above, the program yielded results of great 
practical importance.  Some relations found in the data set collected on 
the woek floor had such potential that when other statistical techniques 
could not confirm those relations, the company resorted to laboratory 
experiments that did indeed confirm the findings by SIPS.

<Program>	SPADE
<Number> 	492
<Domain>	High integrity software.
<Purpose>	To provide formal validation and verification of high-
integrity
software.
<Description>	The SPADE interactive Proof Checker was developed 
to provide formal validation and verification of high-integrity 
software. It can be applied to software written in a variety of 
programming languages: Pascal, 68000 assembler, a provable Ada subset 
("SPARK"). The Proof Checker polices proof
attempts, preventing the user from making incorrect deductions or 
manipulations, and it assists the user in searching for a proof by 
applying a large library of replacement and inference rules using 
pattern matching
techniques. Systematic validation by SPADE during a program 
implementation also significantly reduces the burden of subsequent 
testing and maintenance.

POPLOG was selected for development of the Proof Checker because of its 
conformity to Prolog standards, its rigour in handling integers of 
arbitrary length, and its availability on a number of platforms.

<Program>	Speech synthesis
<Number> 	235
<Domain>	Speech synthesis
<Purpose>	high quality speech synthesis system
<Description>	This uses a non-procedural declarative approach to 
knowledge representation in speech synthesis. The Unification Grammar 
formalism is adopted using directed acyclic graphs as the data structure 
for the representation of phonological words and phrases. The accoustic 
interpretation of such structures is determined by simple constraint-
satisfaction techniques rather than a laboured set of destructive 
transformation rules. This approach avoids many of the practical problems 
encountered in conventional text-to-speech systems, yielding high quality 
speech.

<Program>	Spiral Menu
<Number> 	513
<Domain>	Sprial menu is a graphics user interface, hence a general 
purpose routine. Most efficient use will be in applications where 
items to select may be arranged in alphabetical or numerical order, 
or some other logical order like menus, directories, customer decks, 
geographic indexes, lexical
collections, catalogues, etc.
<Purpose>	Thanks to mouse selection, Sprial Menu allows random access to 
up to 53 items, in graphics mode.
<Description>	Spiral Menu becomes of use in applications 
requiring fast 
selection from a large number of items.
Up to 53 items may be displayed on one single screen.
Random, rather than sequential access is provided for, thanks to 
mouse point and click.
Discrimination and progress analysis between items is enhanced by a 
spiral background, and each box around one name receives a 
distinctive musical identifier.
When mouse arrow enters one box, said box starts blinking and own 
tune goes on, for easy visual and auditive tracking.
Potential enhancements include:
-- multiple selection, color changes, etc.
-- crunching an even larger number of entries, maybe a few hundreds, 
on one single screen.
-- organizing sequences on other compact patterns, maybe dynamic ones.

recommended positioning for the new product. From that information a 
market function is build. The optimization program then runs with 
control of the rule-based deductive reasoning system. If at any time 
the systems analysis does not seem to fit with the reality of the 
scenario, changes can be made in the program definition.
  The system reduces typical project time from 6 months to two weeks.

<Purpose>	a portable programmng system for parallel computers
<Description>	The STRAND88 system is extended to permit multiple users 
to share a running Strand system. The very fine granularity of a CLP 
system; coupled with the stream based nature of user interactions through 
an X window interface; makes practical very flexible information systems 
which offer users considerable scope for sharing data. A demonstration of 
concurrent user updates to a shared spreadsheet and a shared PERT chart 
editor with inter-operability between the tools proves the point.

<Program>	Symbolic Differentiatio and Integrator (DS)
<Number> 	499
<Domain>	Instruction and practical use of Calculus.
<Purpose>	This program symbolically differentiates all common 
mathematical functions and solves most simple integrals ( including 
integration by parts, but not substitution ).
<Description>	 This program symbolically differentiates and 
integrates 
mathematical expressions. It is complete and comes with an easy-to-
use Borland-style user interface with pull-down menus and help 
facility.  Expressions are entered in normal mathematical notation 
(e.g. 5x ^ 3 + tanh (x ^ 2)), are      parsed and then the result is 
displayedin normal notation. The program performs integration and 
differentiation at first-year college level. It automatically uses 
logarithimic differentiation
and integration by parts, but   cannot do variable substitution. It 
has a powerful algebraic simplifier and also numerically evaluates 
expressions. User-defined functions and their        derivatives and 
integrals can be defined, loaded and saved. Program sessions can be 
loaded and saved. The program 
comes with an on-line user manual in English and Swedish. A 45-page thesis 
describing the  inner-workings and algorithms inside the program is 
available only in Swedish.

<Program>	SysView
<Number> 	427
<Domain>	System Administration.
<Purpose>	Distributed System Administration.
<Description>	 - SysView is a set of applications which allows 
centralized
administration of a cluster of UNIX machines on a local
network. The architecture of Sysview is based on the ISO model for 
distributed systems management: An Agent runs on each machine, and 
implements the low level system dependent functionnalities, 
applications implements the user interface  (using OSF/Motif) and the 
high level functionnalities. These applications allows the management 
of  system resources like printers, devices, file systems,
users and so on. 
- SysView works with a Router (OEX) which manage the
information flow between applications and several agents
(commands, responses, events). Applications and Agents
communicate with CMIP protocol. OEX is an SP-Prolog application
- Managed resources are seen like objects, each object is
an instance of a class. Classes are described by ASN.1
templates. Templates are compiled in a schema. Applications
can access template information via OEX. The schema compiler is also a SP-
Prolog application.

architecture supporting high level programming, good use can be made 
of small-sized runnable programs written in the language, that 
exhibit certain statistical features absorbed from the analysis of 
users' programming style. Example of such statistical features are 
the rate of occurrence  of instruction data types. The system's
input consists of the syntax rules of the high-level language and the 
statistical features that we want the generated program to have.

high semantic correlation without direct lexical (keyword) linkage.
Searches focused to return >90% of desired references in a document 
set will contain under 60% undesireable references.  Recursive 
application of proximity/weighting waveform analysis provides 
algorythm and focus/zoom is the interface paradym.
Used primarily in house for specification analysis, this tool is 
equally applicable to symbolic languages other than english.
Technology tracking and historical analysis are seen as areas of high 
potential applicability.

<Description>	The Configurer Graphics service is a value added 
service provided to the users of the ICL Configurer service - 
effectively the entire ICL international sales
force and a number of third party traders.  Configurer allows users 
to create complete and technically correct configurations of the 
entire range of ICL hardware. CGS uses the output from Configurer to 
produce a diagram of this
configuration which can then be printed at source and sent through 
the post to the requesting user, or sent as a POSTSCRIPT file to be 
printed locally.
The application is written in PROLOG (and a shell built on top) with 
calls being made to UNIX scripts. The diagram is built up using a 
declarative language called Maker Interchange Format, which is 
processed through Frame
Technology's FrameMaker package to produce POSTSCRIPT.

processors and supervisor.  Each line processor supports multiple 
closely linked parallel processors for concurrent or sequential 
processing.  Each processor is a separate computer linked by serial 
or modem.  System can act as pay/per/use gateway to 3rd party 
software executed on demand on parallel processors with results 
passed through or merged with output of expert system.  Est. over

<Program>	The Interpreter and Explainer, (TIE), version 3.5
<Number> 	514
<Domain>	Language transliteration. Education. Bulletin Board 
communication.
<Purpose>	TIE is both a transliterator and instantdictionary tool. 
It can be used to convert words from one language into another or used as a 
transcriber of terms, especially for research work.
<Description>	The Interpreter and Explainer enables users to use 
specialized dictionaries of languages or subject matter ot obtain 
explanations of terms. This can be either single terms or two term 
combinations. Textual information can be read 
into TIE or actually typed on the spot.

By placing the cursor at the beginning of a term then pressing the 
return button, a term match will be bought from the appropriate 
dictionary. Successive tapping of the return key or holding it down 
will result in a quick scan of each word or term in a sentence or 
phrase.

Information that is found will be displayed in one of two windows, 
depending upon the length of the explanation. Users can quickly 
define their own terms if they so wish. This enables existing 
dictionaries to be appened to or 
entirely now ones to be created. Language based dictionaries are 
being made that compise some 10,000 common words each, e.g. Italian, 
Spanish and German.

Although the languae conversions are quasi-literal, the context and 
format of conversions makes "reinterpretation" suprisingly good. All 
conversions can be recorded to a log file name.

The program has application for specialized fields of knowledge where 
new terms are constantly being created or is very useful for 
concentrating on (say) biology, medical, law terminology etc. Even 
school children would find it useful in reading sessions.

An advanced version of the program is being planned.

There are many good dictionary programs around but virtually no 
transliteratios of practical worth.

<Program>	THE MANAGER'S EDGE
<Number> 	341
<Domain>	Leadership; Participatory Management; Group Dynamics.
<Purpose>	Portrays trade-off between efficiency and participation for 
autocratic and group leadership styles known to be effective in a 
situation.
<Description>	Does your organization have difficulty making 
decisions?  This expert system will help.  The explanation portion of 
the expert system displays a decision tree to asist the user in 
determining why a question is being asked or a solution has been 
identified.  It is based on over 35 years worth of literature and 
investigation regarding the situational approach to decision making 
and participatory management.  The knowledge acquisition portion 
allows answers with a degree of certainty.  The report portion 
includes the ability to manage filed reports.  One result of a dialog 
with the expert system is a bar chart displaying effective leadership 
styles for the situation.
Hypertext database and context sensitive help convey the theory behind the 
system and detailed explanations regarding the dialog and menus.  The 
software is useful in determining when meetings are inefficient or 
ineffective.  It is also useful in determining when autocratic leadership 
is risky and conversely when group decision making is inappropriate.

<Purpose>	 Intelligent document tracking database.
<Description>	The program was written specifically for Safety 
Case 
documentation, where authorities need to track live issues and problems via 
letters. Sometimes a letter may contain references to several issues, and 
several parties may have responses to one issue. THREAD allows the section 
of the letters and documents pertaining to an issue to be isolated, and the 
user may go forwards or backwards along the thread to check the history of 
that issue. The user may also jump from one issue "thread" to another 
within the currently open document, and also to search the whole database 
for keywords.

<Program>	Timetable Scheduler.
<Number> 	493
<Domain>	Planning, Scheduling.
<Purpose>	Producing timetables for a Polytechnic.
<Description>	A Prolog-based assignment algorithm was written to 
plan for the teaching timetables of the Electronic & Computer 
Engineering Department in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore. The 
timetables were for 1744 students in the first two years of study, 
taught by 137 lecturers in 63 teaching
locations. The students were separated into 15 classes which are sub-
divided into 94 groups, each of about 20 or less persons. Each of the 
94 groups of students will have a timetable with about 30 hours of 
lessons per week. Each lecturer has about 20 hours of teaching 
assignments besides
certain other administrative duties.
        The program has to satisfy numerous constraints and the most 
difficult is due to the heavy utilizations of all the physical facilities. 
The large number of students' curriculum hours per week also complicates 
the task especially towards the end of the scheduling process.

<Purpose>	Diagnosis of communications-related equipment problems.
<Description>	The TMDS software product is designed to help Customer 
Engineers service hardware problems both at the customer site and remotely 
from a National Service Centre.  TMDS Comm. is the communications-related 
portion of this system.  For support of a new communcations controller a 
new architecture was developed in which an embedded prolog system is the 
heart of the diagnostic.  The prolog portion of the product stores 
information about devices and their characteristics.  Upon a command from 
the user, the prolog program generates a sequence of low-level commands to 
hardware-specific servers and other software components which have the 
intended effect.  Any number of devices may be the target of a command.  
Use of prolog is transparent to the user.

<Program>	 Total Network Management - Event Correlation Package.
<Number> 	472
<Domain>	Telecommunications - network monitoring and 
troubleshooting.
<Purpose>	User defined correlation of anomolous  events in 
telecommunication networks.
<Description>	Large telecommunication networks require constant 
monitoring of their switches and facilites to detect and correct any 
problems due to hardware and software failures.
Often a small number of contemporaneous events result in a 
larger problem which consequently generate an additonal number of 
alarms messages. The user has to sort through this dynamically 
changing log to separate the consequences (to try and reduce their 
impact on the customers) and the causes (which need to be fixed).
TNM (Total Network Management), and it's international version - 
MFOS, are an AT&T developed product sold throughout the U.S and the 
world to track and resolve these problems.
Our feature package is a user defined module with a "natural
language" interface that allows the correlation of multiple events  into 
logical groups reflecting a particular problem.

<Program>	TSM - Twin Structure Model of controlled objects .
<Number> 	486
<Domain>	Analysis and Synthesis of Controlled Objects.
<Purpose>	Dynamic simulation of controlled process units or technological 
systems by  the optionally in parallel  executable   coupled structural 
models of conservation and information processes.
<Description>	The Twin Structure Model (TSM) is a coupled pair of  
structural models representing the conservation and  information  
processes, respectively. In the conservational structure the active 
elements correspond to the elementary physical and chemical changes, 
while the state of the system is modeled by  the  extensive  
quantities stored in the passive elements. In the information 
structure  the active  elements  describe  the  various  information  
processing rules, whilst the passive elements are places for the 
signs.  The
connection between the conservation  and  information  structures can 
be interpreted as transformations determining the information sources 
and the intervention of the control.
     The Twin Structure Models can  adequately  be  described  as 
communicating sequential processes. In the PROLOG implementation, the  
structural  elements  are  described  by  dynamic  facts  or clauses, 
while the various tasks can be executed by  the  
generalmetainterpreting clauses of the kernel. The communication 
between the conservation and information  models  can  be  organized  
via special messages.
From the analysis of the Twin Structure Models the so-called
cybernetic characteristics of the semiring-like structure can  be
studied. The design of the control algorithms can be interpreted as 
synthesizing feedforward routes and  feedback  loops  for  the achievement  
of  the  prescribed,  stable  functioning of the conservation system in 
question.

<Purpose>	A problem solver with learning capabilities
<Description>	UBL learns solving methods by analyzing solutions. 
Trying to understand these solutions then allows generalizations to 
be drawn. A problem is presented as a set of n-ary relations between 
objects, consdered as hypotheses, and by a specific relation 
representing the goal to prove. UBL uses knowledge given by the user 
or learned previously expressed in the form if <conjunction of 
relations> then <conjunction of relations>. 
It uses sophisticated unification using an equational theory, a 
compromise between forward checking and backward chaining, an 
analysis of rules and a learning method.
Its main testing area has been in Euclidean geometry.

<Description>	Ushell is a simple environment for developing and testing 
simple logic programs. The application is based on a Prolog meta-level 
interpreter with iterative deepening. This method overcomes some of the 
completeness problems of the Prolog interpreter by displaying solutions up 
to a preset limit in the search tree. The shell also provides user 
explanation of the deductions.

<Program>	Vegetation Management Tools
<Number> 	5
<Domain>	Forest management
<Purpose>	To provide a framework within which forest managers can 
select
the best herbicide treatment for a particular set of weeds and crop
situation.
<Description>	The system is configured as a domain-specific shell and 
consists of two programs; one for information input; and one for use of 
information.  The input program allows experts to enter relevant 
information about weeds; herbicides; surfactants; application methods; and 
their interactions.  Input is both in structured form (stored in frames); 
and unstructured (stored as text in a database).  The other program asks 
managers to define their sites; and then allows them to explore options for 
management.  The program selects the most cost- effective treatments (given 
criteria nominated by the user); and provides warnings of environmental 
hazards.  Unstructured information can be accessed when relevant.

<Program>	VEX/ATL
<Number> 	67
<Domain>	Planning in distributed networks
<Purpose>	Production of routing tables for a distributed telecom network
<Description>	The task performed by VEX/ATL is to produce control 
data for the switches in a distributed telecom net. The control data 
produced is in the form of tables. The data tables control the 
priority path for routing a call through the network. The information 
used for  constructing the tables is the network's topology and the 
selection  algorithm used by the switches to chose an outgoing line 
from its table. Complexity arises due to the use of different switch 
types in the network which use different algorithms. Heuristics have 
been built up by a small group of experts working over many years. 
VEX/ATL has incorporated these heuristics into a system and has 
automated this previously manual task. A significant amount of code 
is used in implimenting a user-friendly interface for entering 
network information and presentation of produced data.

<Program>	WFProlog (well-founded Prolog).

<Domain>	Default reasoning systems needing an underlying inference 
system (Prolog style interpreter) based on well-founded semantics.
<Purpose>	A Prolog meta-interpreter that computes well-founded semantics 
for normal logic programs using negation as failure.
<Description>	The interpreter is based upon a formal, top-down, tree 
specification for well-founded semantics (see reference).  The interpreter 
is, in fact, an executable specification of  the top-down tree semantics in 
the form of a Prolog program (written in Quintus Prolog).  The resulting 
procedure -- which we call SLD3NF -- computes 3-valued well-founded answers 
to queries.   The interpreter is quite general, programs and goals can have 
variables,  any built-in goals can be called, and programs can be 
conveniently loaded from source files in usual ways.

<Purpose>	 Explaining behaviour of an expert system written in Prolog
<Description>	XPL is an explanation shell built in Prolog by using 
meta-programming techniques. The heart of the shell is an integrated meta-
interpreter which handles both successes and failures in layers. The 
layered design allows handling of negation and failure; including cuts; and 
successes in a single interpreter. The shell provides why; how; whynot and 
bywhom type of explanations in one shell and allows dynamic user input to 
the knowledge base by query-the-user facilities . It also illustrates the 
interactions of cuts with the execution.

<Program>	XTRACT
<Number> 	451
<Domain>	Text analysis for information extraction.
<Purpose>	Extract and analyse costing information from capture files 
generated from communication dialogues with on-line databases.
<Description>	The application consists of two parts:
1. Information extraction from text files
2. Database reports on accumulated information .              

Information extraction:
----------------------
Through the use of user definable text templates, the system will 
search a text file for matches. The templates consists of fixed text 
expressions and variable names. A template matches a block of text 
when all the fixed text components
can be matched in that block, the variables are then assigned to the 
text at their position eg.  Template:
        Total cost at HR; MIN is COST dollars
Will match:
        Total cost at 3:15 is 20.32 dollars
With variables bound as follows:
        HR=3. MIN=15, COST=20.32
The user may also supply equations and look up tables to be used in 
calculating other variable values. Variables with reserved names may 
then be asserted into a database.           

Database reports:
-----------------
The database may be inspected and reports generated in either text or 
comma deliminated file formats. These may be used for reporting, 
invoicing etc.  The system currently supports six international 
information hosts, another ten 
or so are to be added before product release.
