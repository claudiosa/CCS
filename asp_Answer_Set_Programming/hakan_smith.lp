% Mr Smith problem in ASP.
% 
% From an IF Prolog example (http://www.ifcomputer.de/)
% """
% The Smith family and their three children want to pay a visit but they
% do not all have the time to do so. Following are few hints who will go
% and who will not:
%     - If Mr Smith comes, his wife will come too.
%     - At least one of their two sons Matt and John will come.
%     - Either Mrs Smith or Tim will come, but not both.
%     - Either Tim and John will come, or neither will come.
%     - If Matt comes, then John and his father will
%       also come.
% """
%
% The answer should be that John and Tim will go.
