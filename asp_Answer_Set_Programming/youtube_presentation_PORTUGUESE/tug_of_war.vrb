\frametitle{Conclusions:}
	
\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}

  \item ASP is strongly declarative (roots from the logic to attack the  representation and combinatorial problems)

  \item A methodology generate and test to developing

  \item ASP's workflow, modeling, grounding, solving
    (and optimizing)
    %\smallskip
  \item Here, we solved \emph{the tug of war problem}. Easy to understand, but is is a combinatorial problem.

  \item Allows you to embbed a Python coding in order to minimize the difficulties (\Smiley) of input and output data
		
   \item An encoding in ASP is excellent exercise to keep your mind very active!

	\item Finally, a huge gratitude for the \textcolor{green}{\textbf{potassco-users list}}, always reactive for my silly doubts,  where I had been learning much.
