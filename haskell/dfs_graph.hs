DFS - Depth First Search or DFS for a Graph

 Usage: $ ghci
*DFS_SEARCH> :l dfs_graph.hs  
[1 of 1] Compiling DFS_SEARCH       ( dfs_graph.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
*DFS_SEARCH> go
	 Depth First Search or DFS for a Graph	
	 One path is: [1,4,7,6,8]

Representation of this Graph:
Nodes and edges are represented by pairs ... directly
[(1,2),(1,4),(2,5),(3,6),(2,3),(3,4),(4,7),(5,6),(6,7)]

Example:
Departure node: 1
End/Arrival node: 7

PS: No weight in this version -- easily extendeable
