They get themselves learned and learned well, so that they get played long and hard by a great many people. This is how they and their designers survive and perpetuate themselves. If a game cannot be learned and even mastered at a certain level, it won't get played by enough people, and the company that makes it will go broke. Good learning in games is a capitalist-driven Darwinian process of selection of the fittest. Of course, game designers could have solved their learning problems by making games shorter and easier, by dumbing them down, so to speak. But most gamers don't want short and easy games. Thus, designers face and largely solve an intriguing educational dilemma, one also faced by schools and workplaces: how to get people, often young people, to learn and master something that is long and challenging--and enjoy it, to boot.},

We consider an emotional state as the layer between personality and emotion. The proposed affective model offers a mapping between emotions and emotional states. To evidence emotional states of a virtual character, we can attribute them facial expressions based on their associated emotions. Facial expressions for intermediate emotions are generated automatically from expressions for universal emotions. The experiments show coherent emotional states produced by a simulated story. They also present how the corresponding emotions were represented through dynamic and static facial expressions. Finally, the obtained results demonstrate the satisfactory recognition by a group of people unfamiliar with the work described. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Different categories of digital personalities are introduced, in particular virtual actors for {CG-movies} are explained in more detail because of the importance of understanding the functioning of virtual actors—other types of virtual personalities will often be build upon the faculties of virtual actors. It is proposed that an essential feature of the prospective authoring process of digital personalities is the support of generalization. This would allow for a “concrete authoring”, that modifies and defines concrete cases. Thus, the author would be able to employ concrete cases as basis for generalizations. In this context, possible technologies that would support a concrete authoring process are presented, in particular {Case-Based} Reasoning.

If multi-agent systems are to become widely accepted as a basis for large-scale applications, adequate agent-oriented methodologies and modelling techniques will be essential. This is not just to ensure that systems are reliable, maintainable, and conformant, but to allow their design, implementation, and maintenance to be carried out by software analysts and engineers rather than researchers. In this paper we describe an agent-oriented methodology and modelling technique for systems of agents based upon the {Belief-Desire-Intention} {(BDI)} paradigm. Our models extend existing {Object-Oriented} {(OO)} models. By building upon and adapting existing, well-understood techniques, we take advantage of their maturity to produce an approach that can be easily learnt and understood by those familiar with the {OO} paradigm.},

The play, performed before live audiences in November 1997, brought an automatic computer character to a theatrical stage for the first time ever. This paper reports the experience and examines important technical developments needed for the successful production of {"It/I".} In particular we describe the interval script paradigm used to program the computer character and the {ACTSCRIPT} language for communication of actions and goals. Although our experiments have been restricted to physical interactive spaces, we believe that interval scripts and {ACTSCRPT} can successfully address the control and management of any virtual environment with a complex temporal structure or a strong underlying narrative.},

Within this game, it pays for the users to create social bounds with the virtual character, and to adapt the natural language, typed input to the limited natural language processing faculties of the agent. We expect that the socially complex scenario will enhance learning pleasure and efficiency. The game also aims at clarifying educational, technological and conceptual problems related to the creation of social bounds with virtual agents, and to the use of natural language in this context. Specifically, this game is an environment where the concept of a rationally profitable social relationship with a virtual agent can be examined.},

Improvisation is an essential part of rehearsals for a live stage (scripted) performance, providing development of character and plot; in addition, the rehearsal process provides a training ground for the actors involved with the performance. The author aims to develop synthetic characters capable of taking full part in this process. Initial experiments (dynamically adding an affect component to scripted speech, and evolving variations of movement) have been promising, and form the beginnings of the larger system, which will autonomously build up a model of the character that the synthetic actor is portraying, with the aim of presenting continually improved performances.},

The results from the study showed that there are behaviors and gestures that most users will easily pick up to express emotions. It told us which dimensions of movements (distance to screen, movements of limbs, etc.) that work most easily will be picked up by users. We describe in what way the results from the study have affected the design of the {SenToy} and the hardware requirements. Wizard of Oz studies have previously been used for natural language interface and intelligent agent design and we show that it can also be used in the domain of affective input-device design.},

	abstract = {A technique and philosophy for controlling computer animation is discussed. Using the {Actor/Scriptor} Animation System {(ASAS)} a sequence is described by the animator as a formal written {SCRIPT}, which is in fact a program in an animation/graphic language. Getting the desired animation is then equivalent to “debugging” the script. Typical images manipulated with {ASAS} are synthetic, {3D} perspective, color, shaded images. However, the animation control techniques are independent of the underlying software and hardware of the display system, so apply to other types (still, {B\&W}, {2D}, line drawing ...). Dynamic (and static) graphics are based on a set of geometric object data types and a set of geometric operators on these types. Both sets are extensible. The operators are applied to the objects under the control of modular animated program structures. These structures (called actors) allow parallelism, independence, and optionally, synchronization, so that they can render the full range of the time sequencing of events. Actors are the embodiment of imaginary players in a simulated movie. A type of animated number can be used to drive geometric expressions (nested geometrical operators) with dynamic parameters to produce animated objects. Ideas from programming styles used in current Artificial Intelligence research inspired the design of {ASAS}, which is in fact an extension to the Lisp programming environment. {ASAS} was developed in an academic research environment and made the transition to the “real world” of commercial motion graphics production.},

contributions of this paper are the following. First, we present a pipeline that extracts, processes, and renders emotion
of {3D} virtual human {(VH).} The extraction of emotion is based on data mining statistic of large cyberspace databases. Second,
we propose methods to optimize this computational pipeline so that real-time virtual reality rendering can be achieved on
common {PCs.} Third, we use the Poisson distribution to transfer database extracted lexical and language parameters into coherent
intensities of valence and arousal—parameters of Russell’s circumplex model of emotion. The last contribution is a practical
color interpretation of emotion that influences the emotional aspect of rendered {VHs.} To test our method’s efficiency, computational
statistics related to classical or untypical cases of emotion are provided. In order to evaluate our approach, we applied
our method to diverse areas such as cyberspace forums, comics, and theater dialogs.},

In the present study, participants responded to a standardized laboratory situation with a variety of different emotions. Appraisals predicted the intensity of individual emotions across participants. In addition, subgroups of participants with similar emotional response profiles made comparable appraisals. Together, these findings suggest that appraisals may be necessary and sufficient to determine different emotional reactions toward a particular situation.},

from “true” beliefs, desires and intentions? This question is often cast as a dichotomy between competing theoretical perspectives.
Theorists like Ekman argue for the primacy of emotion as a determinant of nonverbal behavior: emotions “leak” and only indirectly
serve social ends. In contrast, theorists such as Fridlund argue for the primacy of social ends in determining nonverbal displays.
This dichotomy has worked to divide virtual character research. Whereas there have been advances in modeling emotion, this
work is often seen as irrelevant to the generation of communicative behavior. In this chapter, I review current findings on
the interpersonal function of emotion. I’ll discuss recent developments in Social Appraisal theory as a way to bridge this
dichotomy and our attempts to model these functions within the context of embodied conversational agents.},

	abstract = {In our approach we explore emotional effects of virtual agents without human interaction. The idea is the following: emotion is considered a valuable means to explain social phenomena like the emergence of costly punishment. Now, would it be possible to put together a population of agents which mimics human society? Would it even be possible to show that certain personality configurations and emotional behavior emerge from interactions in a virtual agent society experiment? In previous work we selected the public goods game with punishment option because of its intriguing property of affect-based decisions [1]. In this paper we present our first approach to virtual agent population modelling which adopts a setting of the public goods game as it is used for studies on cooperative behaviour (see [1][3]). The discrete version of the game distinguishes between the roles of the punisher, the cooperator and the defector. As shown in [3] the iterated public goods game leads to a predominance of the defectors. This is changed by giving the participants the freedom to choose whether to participate in the game or not which gives the punishers a chance to get back into the game and it is shown that eventually they become dominant (see [3]).},

	abstract = {Our goal is to simulate the full hair geometry, consisting of approximately one hundred thousand hairs on a typical human head. This will require scalable methods that can simulate every hair as opposed to only a few guide hairs. Novel to this approach is that the individual hair/hair interactions can be modeled with physical parameters (friction, static attraction, etc.) at the scale of a single hair as opposed to clumped or continuum interactions. In this vein, we first propose a new altitude spring model for preventing collapse in the simulation of volumetric tetrahedra, and we show that it is also applicable both to bending in cloth and torsion in hair. We demonstrate that this new torsion model for hair behaves in a fashion similar to more sophisticated models with significantly reduced computational cost. For added efficiency, we introduce a semi-implicit discretization of standard springs that makes them truly linear in multiple spatial dimensions and thus unconditionally stable without requiring {Newton-Raphson} iteration. We also simulate complex hair/hair interactions including sticking and clumping behavior, collisions with objects (e.g. head and shoulders) and self-collisions. Notably, in line with our goal to simulate the full head of hair, we do not generate any new hairs at render time.},

otherwise impossible characters, similar use within live
stage performances is relatively uncommon. Even within film,
these characters have, until recently, been mere puppets

research carried out at Massey University into autonomous
synthetic (computer) actors that are capable of learning
through the rehearsal process, alongside human counterparts.
In particular, the paper describes a production of Orson
Scott Card’s Porcelain Salamander, which utilised
synthetic actors for one main role, and various minor roles,
as well as four human actors. Throughout the rehearsal
process, the synthetic characters refined their performance,
through the typical loop of improvisation followed by
feedback from a director, until their final performance was
optimal. The synthetic actors utilised visual data (from
cameras), audio data (from a central microphone), and were
actuated via projected graphical displays and output into
the theatre sound system. This paper lightly covers the
technical aspects of the learning and improvisational
techniques utilised by the synthetic actors. It concentrates
more on phenomenological},

	abstract = {Working with emotion-related states in technological contexts requires a standard representation format. Based on that premise, the {W3C} Emotion Incubator group was created to lay the foundations for such a standard. The paper reports on two results of the group's work: a collection of use cases, and the resulting requirements. We compiled a rich collection of use cases, and grouped them into three types: data annotation, emotion recognition, and generation of emotion-related behaviour. Out of these, a structured set of requirements was distilled. It comprises the representation of the emotion-related state itself, some meta-information about that representation, various kinds of links to the "rest of the world", and several kinds of global metadata. We summarise the work, and provide pointers to the working documents containing full details.},

	abstract = {Agent-oriented system development aims to simplify the construction of complex systems by introducing a natural abstraction layer on top of the object-oriented paradigm composed of autonomous interacting actors. One main advantage of the agent metaphor is that an agent can be described similar to the characteristics of the human mind consisting of several interrelated concepts which constitute the internal agent structure. General consensus exists that the {Belief-Desire-Intention} {(BDI)} model is well suited for describing an agents mental state. The desires (goals) of an agent represent its motivational stance and are the main source for the agents actions. Therefore, the representation and handling of goals play a central role in goal-oriented requirements analysis and modelling techniques. Nevertheless, currently available {BDI} agent platforms mostly abstract from goals and do not represent them explicitly. This leads to a gap between design and implementation with respect to the available concepts. In this paper a generic representation of goal types, properties, and lifecycles is developed in consideration of existing goal-oriented requirements engineering and modelling techniques. The objective of this proposal is to bridge the gap between agent specification and implementation of goals and is backed by experiences gained from developing a generic agent framework.},

The starting point of this research, is an existing application known as "edrama", a {2D} graphical environment in which users are represented by static cartoon figures. Tools have been developed to enable integration of the existing edrama application with several new components to support avatars with emotionally expressive behaviours, rendered in a {3D} environment. The functionality includes the extraction of affect from open-ended improvisational text. The results of the affective analysis are then used to: (a) control an automated improvisational {AI} actor - {EMMA} (emotion, metaphor and affect) that operates a bit-part character in the improvisation; (b) drive the animations of avatars using the Demeanour framework in the user interface so that they react bodily in ways that are consistent with the affect that they are expressing. Finally, we describe user trials that demonstrate that the changes made improve the quality of social interaction and users' sense of presence. Moreover, our system has the potential to evolve normal classroom education for young people with or without learning disabilities by providing 24/7 efficient personalised social skill, language and career training via role-play and offering automatic monitoring.},

	abstract = {Autonomous virtual humans play an important role in dynamic virtual environment. Research in psychology and neuroscience has identified both the critical role of emotion in decision-making and social interaction. Due to this, to simulate virtual human's believable social communication, a personality-emotion model should be constructed based on artificial psychology first. There are two crucial problems to creating agents that display believable emotions which are how to construct model for emotion, and how emotion model to be applied in agent for improve its performance. In this paper, fuzzy dynamic Bayesian network which is a modification of the dynamic Bayesian network {(DBN)} is adopted to solve the two questions. Fuzzy logic system enhances our capabilities of capturing the intrinsic uncertainty of human common-sense reasoning and decision-making during their communications. Moreover, dynamic Bayesian network is used to construct the human's personality-emotion model to simulate the transformation of human's emotion. Nonverbal communication is adopted to present our virtual human's emotion change. Nonverbal communication is crucial to increase the believability of virtual humans, during which virtual humans respond not only to the presence of others but also to their postures. An application of this model to create virtual humans involved in social interactions in a virtual community is presented. The interlocutors express their emotion change to one another through their gestures and distance zones. By some experiments of virtual human's nonverbal communication, this system is proved to be able to increase the believability of virtual human to a great extent},

The story understanding module extracts actions that are not explicitly described in the story and makes a scenario. The stage directing module adapts the scenario by determining the actors' positions on the stage and setting the stage. Actors are defined as {3-Dimensional} articulated figures. Each component of an actor has its primitive motion method. To achieve complicated actions, primitive motions are combined. Referring to these complicated actions, the action generating module produces animated sequences from the adapted scenario. These three modules are tightly coupled with their knowledge bases. As an example, the story of the {“Hare} and Tortoise” from Aesop's Fables, written for elementary schoolchildren is used. This example proves that it is possible to produce computer animation directly from the story written in natural language, now in Japanese.},

	abstract = {Virtual conversational agents are supposed to combine speech with
non-verbal modalities for intelligible and believable utterances.
However, the automatic synthesis of co-verbal gestures is still
struggling with several problems like naturalness in procedurally
generated animations, flexibility in pre-defined movements, and
synchronization with speech. In this paper we focus on generating
complex multimodal utterances including gesture and speech from
{XML-based} descriptions of their overt form. We describe a coordination
model that reproduces coarticulation and transition effects in both
modalities. In particular, an efficient kinematic approach to creating
gesture animations from shape specifications is presented, which
provides fine adaptation to temporal constraints that are imposed by
cross-modal synchrony},

	url = {http://www.springerlink.com/content/g47a13xeput9nxbc},
	abstract = {The new interactive ways of storytelling, which can be realised as interactive narratives, virtual storytelling, interactive fiction, interactive drama, are often regarded as a significant break from traditional storytelling methods. In this paper we focus on the role of a person in an interactive storytelling context who facilitates the story construction process, the Director. The term Director is often associated with roles such as theatre director, stage director, film director or even television director. The meaning usually assigned to this concept is of someone who: ”oversees and orchestrates the mounting of a play by unifying various endeavours and aspects of production. The director’s function is to ensure the quality and completeness of a theatrical product”. In our research, the concept of a Director is extended and does not only have the role of supervising the acting in a play where every actor knows his/her role in a well-known plot, but to supervise the role being played by a set of autonomous virtual characters and to provide support to the users that engage in the story by controlling and commanding virtual actors. In our view, our concept of a Director is challenging because its role is vital in the sense that it does not only supervise a set of synthetic characters but has to accommodate the choices made by the users, within our context children, and at the same time guarantee that the coherence of the story is maintained.},

Previous approaches to textual affect sensing have employed keyword spotting, lexical affinity, statistical methods, and hand-crafted models. This paper demonstrates a new approach, using large-scale real-world knowledge about the inherent affective nature of everyday situations (such as "getting into a car accident") to classify sentences into "basic" emotion categories. This commonsense approach has new robustness {implications.Open} Mind Commonsense was used as a real world corpus of 400,000 facts about the everyday world. Four linguistic models are combined for robustness as a society of commonsense-based affect recognition. These models cooperate and compete to classify the affect of text. Such a system that analyzes affective qualities sentence by sentence is of practical value when people want to evaluate the text they are writing. As such, the system is tested in an email writing application. The results suggest that the approach is robust enough to enable plausible affective text user interfaces.},

	abstract = {Fundamental to case-based reasoning is the idea that similar problems have similar solutions. The meaning of the concept of "similarity" can vary in different situations and remains an issue. Since we want to identify and retrieve truly useful or relevant cases for problem solving, the metrics of similarity must be defined suitably to reflect the utility of cases for solving a particular target problem. A framework for utility-oriented similarity modeling is developed in this paper. The main idea is to exploit a case library to obtain adequate samples of utility from pairs of cases. The task of similarity modeling then becomes the customization of the parameters in a similarity metric to minimize the discrepancy between the assessed similarity values and the utility scores desired. A new structure for similarity metrics is introduced which enables the encoding of single feature impacts and more competent approximation of case utility. Preliminary experimental results have shown that the proposed approach can be used for learning with a surprisingly small case base without the risk of over-fitting and that it yields stable system performance with variations in the threshold selected for case retrieval.},

Many computer experiments show that cooperation does arise under certain conditions. However, little attention has been paid to aspects of emotions in this context. The goal of this work is thus to develop a framework for modelling agents with emotions. It allows the design of such agents, which interact with neighbours or their social groups. This paper describes a scenario in which agents may have various types of emotions, and which uses the {IPD} as a metaphor for social interactions. We compare our results with standard ones achieved in the scenario of a two-dimensional array of either cooperators or defectors, without any kind of emotion involved. Our results show that the ratio of cooperators is slightly higher when agents make decisions using emotions. This might be explained by the fact that agents are not so short-sighted in that they always either cooperate or defect. Rather, their flexibility increases when they are able to use emotions to decide which course of action to take during the game.},

Agents {(ECAs).} We propose a three stage model we call {SAIBA} where the stages represent intent planning, behavior planning
and behavior realization. A Function Markup Language {(FML)}, describing intent without referring to physical behavior, mediates
between the first two stages and a Behavior Markup Language {(BML)} describing desired physical realization, mediates between
the last two stages. In this paper we will focus on {BML.} The hope is that this abstraction and modularization will help {ECA}
researchers pool their resources to build more sophisticated virtual humans.},

Then we associate tentative, yet specific, {ECA} gestural behaviour with each of the main dialogue stages, with special emphasis on problem situations. In the second part we describe the tests we have carried out to validate our {ECA's} gestural repertoire. The results obtained show that users generally understand and naturally accept the gestures, to a reasonable degree. This encourages us to proceed with the next stage of research: evaluating the gestural strategy in real dialogue situations with the aim of learning about how to favour a more efficient and pleasant dialogue flow for the users.},

Innovations and modifications to this methodology from the commercial sector are then reviewed, and the steps in this methodology are described, as implemented in current best practices. Finally, new research efforts based on this methodology are examined, including the introduction of natural language processing technology to enable human-computer conversations and the integration of branching storylines into real-time virtual reality environments. A prototype application to support leadership development within the {U.S.} Army that includes these advances is described.},

Simulation results show the great potential of expression of {FuSM}, due to the fact that it can act on several states at the same time. Promising results were obtained with the proposed new {FuSM} transfer function, which was able to efficiently smoothen transitions among emotion states, creating good quality facial expressions.},

In this logic, goals are a consistent set of desires, and this property is fundamental to the semantics of the logic. However, implementations based on this framework typically have no explicit representation of either desires or goals, and consequently no mechanisms for checking consistency. In this paper we address this gap between theory and practice by giving an explicit representation for a simple class of desires. The simplicity of this class makes it both straightforward and efficient to check for consistency. We provide a general framework for conflict resolution based on a preference ordering of sets of goals, and we illustrate how different rules for specifying consistent goal sets (corresponding to different preference orderings) relate to existing commitment strategies. We also report on some implementation experiments which confirm that the cost of consistency maintenance is not significant.},

We present an example actor, whose low-level behavior is modeled after physiological analyses of cockroach motor behavior. The sensori-motor activity of our roach is generated by a hierarchical control structure. Coupled oscillators generate basic gait patterns, which are modified by reflexes feeding in from the environment. Stepping and stance are executed by kinematic motor programs, which move the legs and body. The reactive level associates motor behavior with events in the virtual environment, to simulate perception and implement higher level behaviors. The activity of the virtual actor is determined only when it is situated in the environment, and interacts with the user and other simulations.},

The aim is to create virtual humans that can interact spontaneously using a natural language, emotions and gestures. This paper discusses a system that allows the design of personality for emotional virtual human. We adopt the Five Factor Model {(FFM)} of personality from psychology studies. To realize the model, we use Bayesian Belief Network. We introduce a layered approach for modeling personality, moods and emotions. In order to demonstrate a virtual human with emotional personality, we integrate the system into a chat application. Thus, the system enables the developer to design and implement personalities and enables the user to interact with them.},

	abstract = {Abstract  For the past few years, the storytelling research domain has raised the interest of several researchers from different areas
(such as interactive drama, computer games, intelligent learning environment etc.), mainly because stories are an important
vehicle to structure the human knowledge and past experience, and even to help people to behave in a social context. In this
paper, we present a storytelling approach, which is based on the premise that story and narrative may emerge from characters’
interactions during the creation activity, but such characters may either act autonomously or be controlled by children. Since
we position our research in an educational context, we argue that in such creation activities children’s thoughts and needs
must be respected and contribute directly to the achievement of the story. Therefore, children should be provided with some
support and guidance directives to help them to better understand and reflect on the role-taking situations they experience
during such activity. To prove the validity of our approach we developed a generic {architecture—Support} And Guidance Architecture
{(SAGA).} {SAGA} aims not only to provide support and guidance to children during the story telling activities, by combining the
roles of a dynamic script writer and a drama manager, but also to provide such services to already existing story creation applications. To illustrate this, we have integrated {SAGA} with Teatrix, a collaborative
virtual environment for story creation, and an evaluation study was conducted in order to find the impact of {SAGA} in children’s
storytelling activities.},

	abstract = {{Concept-to-Speech} {(CTS)} systems, which aim to synthesize
speech from semantic information and discourse context, have
succeeded in producing more appropriate and naturalsounding
prosody than text-to-speech {(TTS)} systems, which rely mostly
on syntactic and orthographic information. In this paper, we
show how recent advances in {CTS} systems can be used to
improve intonation in text reading systems for English.
Specifically, following {(Prevost}, 1995; Prevost, 1996), we
show how information structure is used by our program to
produce intonational patterns with context-appropriate
variation in pitch accent type and prominence. Following
{(Cahn}, 1994; Cahn, 1997), we also show how some of the
semantic information used by such {CTS} systems can be drawn
from {WordNet} {(Miller} et al., 1993), a large-scale semantic
lexicon. 1},

Experiments with Lea have shown that 79\% of people reacted positively in spite of lowness that is 57\% adequacy of reactions.

Personality and emotion-driven Believable Agents are needed in areas like human–machine interfaces, electronic advertising and, most notably, electronic entertainment. Computer models of personality can help explain personality by illustrating its underlying structure and dynamics. This work presents a neural network model of personality and personality change. The goals are to help understand personality and create more realistic and believable characters for interactive video games. The model is based largely on trait theories of personality. Behaviour in the model results from the interaction of three components: (1) personality-based predispositions for behaviour, (2) moods/emotions and (3) environmental situations. Personality develops gradually over time depending on the situations encountered. Modelling personality change produces interesting and believable virtual characters whose behaviours change in psychologically plausible ways.},

Two objectives drive the development of the {'Senet'} project described in this paper: to develop a set of design guidelines for the use of virtual actors in Collaborative Virtual Environments {(CVEs)} for learning, and to inform the development of the underlying virtual actor technology following a user centred approach. The methodological approach followed involves the development of prototype virtual learning environments in a series of distinct phases. These are based on an ancient Egyptian game (senet) and are aimed at children at Key Stage Level 2 of the National Curriculum for education in England. Two-dimensional multimedia technology has been used to develop robust prototypes, which were then observed in use by children. The result of this study derived a set of design guidelines, which were then used to guide the implementation of a {3D} {CVE} using the Deva {CVE} technology.},

To that end, we describe a practical approach to real-time learning for synthetic characters. Our implementation is grounded in the techniques of reinforcement learning and informed by insights from animal training. It simplifies the learning task for characters by (a) enabling them to take advantage of predictable regularities in their world, (b) allowing them to make maximal use of any supervisory signals, and (c) making them easy to train by {humans.We} built an autonomous animated dog that can be trained with a technique used to train real dogs called "clicker training". Capabilities demonstrated include being trained to recognize and use acoustic patterns as cues for actions, as well as to synthesize new actions from novel paths through its motion {space.A} key contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that by addressing the three problems of state, action, and state-action space discovery at the same time, the solution for each becomes easier. Finally, we articulate heuristics and design principles that make learning practical for synthetic characters.},

To simulate emotional expressions in an interactive environment, an intelligent agent needs both an adaptive model for generating believable responses, and a visualization model for mapping emotions into facial expressions. Recent advances in intelligent agents and in facial modeling have produced effective algorithms for these tasks independently. We describe a method for integrating these algorithms to create an interactive simulation of an agent that produces appropriate facial expressions in a dynamic environment. Our approach to combining a model of emotions with a facial model represents a first step towards developing the technology of a truly believable interactive agent which has a wide range of applications from designing intelligent training systems to video games and animation tools},

We lay out a general computational framework of appraisal and coping as a central organizing principle for such systems. We then discuss a detailed domain-independent model based on this framework, illustrating how it has been applied to the problem of generating behavior for a significant social training application. The model is useful not only for deriving emotional state, but also for informing a number of the behaviors that must be modeled by virtual humans such as facial expressions, dialogue management, planning, reacting, and social understanding. Thus, the work is of potential interest to models of strategic decision-making, action selection, facial animation, and social intelligence.},

search based planning can satisfy the real-time requirements of interactive storytelling, while still being compatible with
the narrative formalisation we are pursuing. We then describe into greater detail a short episode generated by the system,
which illustrates both high-level results and technical aspects, such as re-planning and user intervention. Further work will
be dedicated to developing more complex narrative representations and investigating the relations between natural language
semantics and narrative structures in the context of interactive storytelling.},

the most important features for creating such character? This paper presents a study where the influence of different modalities
in the perception of a story told by both a synthetic storyteller and a real one are analyzed. In order to evaluate it, three
modes of communication were taken into account: voice, facial expression and gestures. One hundred and eight students from
computer science watched a video where a storyteller narrated the traditional Portuguese story entitled {”O} Coelhinho Branco”
{(The} little white rabbit). The students were divided into four groups. Each of these groups saw one video where the storyteller
was portrayed either by a synthetic character or a human. The storyteller’s voice, no matter the nature of the character,
could also be real or synthetic. After the video display, the participants filled a questionnaire where they rated the storyteller’s
performance. Although the synthetic versions used in the experiment obtained lower classifications than their natural counterparts,
the data suggests that the gap between synthetic and real gestures is the smallest while the synthetic voice is the furthest
from its natural version. Furthermore, when we used the synthetic voice, the facial expressions of both characters (the virtual
and the real) were rated worse than with the real voice. This effect was not significant for the gestures, thus suggesting
that the importance of building synthetic voices as natural as possible is extremely important as it impacts in the perception
of other means of communication (such as the perception of the facial expression).},

These agent-based models {(ABMs)} show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. {ABMs} provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shif...},

	abstract = {While multi-agent systems seem to provide a good basis for building complex software systems, this paper points out some of the drawbacks of classical “agent centered” multi-agent systems. To resolve these difficulties we claim that organization centered multi-agent system, or {OCMAS} for short, may be used. We propose a set of general principles from which true {OCMAS} may be designed. One of these principles is not to assume anything about the cognitive capabilities of agents. In order to show how {OCMAS} models may be designed, we propose a very concise and minimal {OCMAS} model called {AGR}, for {Agent/Group/Role.} We propose a set of notations and a methodological framework to help the designer to build {MAS} using {AGR.} We then show that it is possible to design multi-agent systems using only {OCMAS} models.},

of game content and interaction. The poker characters rely on a sophisticated model of affect and a state-of-the art speech

affect in speech and animations. As a result, users are provided with an engaging interactive poker experience.},

However, the relation between believability, on one side, and the role a character plays in a drama, on the other, has not yet been fully addressed. In this paper we will present a view on how to develop believable synthetic characters whose behaviour is based on a set of predefined functions {(Propp's} functions) associated with the role they play in the story. To illustrate the approach, we will present a collaborative virtual environment, Teatrix, designed for children to build their own stories-fairy tales. In Teatrix, virtual actors play roles (such as villain, hero, magician, etc), which are functional for the development of the story. Such roles have pre-defined goals and plans, allowing the story to flow and climax situations to arise. Teatrixis already in use by children ages between 7 and 9, in the context of a {Computer-Integrated} Classroom scenario.},

nonverbal-nonvocal natural language. We present a framework for
synchronizing speech with facial movements, gesture and body posture by
combining findings from linguistics and psychology. The interaction
process incorporates the parsing of a textual natural language
utterance, the emotion-based triggering of a textual response and its
vocal and visual performance-speech synthesis linked with
lip-synchronous generation of facial expressions and gestures},

Although the expressive power of link grammars is equivalent to that of context free grammars, encoding natural language grammars appears to be much easier with the new system. We have written a program for general link parsing and written a link grammar for the English language. The performance of this preliminary system -- both in the breadth of English phenomena that it captures and in the computational resources used -- indicates that the approach may have practical uses as well as linguistic significance.
