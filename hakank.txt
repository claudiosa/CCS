Hi Claudio.

Thanks for your comments.

Your pictures got me curious if one could use graphwiz for showing the graphs.

So I added the following code to print a graphwiz .dot file of the graph. (it's last in http://hakank.org/hakank.org/picat/dist_vertex_claudio.pi )
"""
   %
   % Print The links to a .dot format
   %
   % $ dot -Tpdf dist_vertex_claudio.dot -o dist_vertex_claudio.pdf  
   % $ sfdp -Tpdf dist_vertex_claudio.dot -o dist_vertex_claudio.pdf
   % $ neato -Tpdf dist_vertex_claudio.dot -o dist_vertex_claudio.pdf
   %
   DotFile = "dist_vertex_claudio.dot",
   printf("\nThe links in .dot format: %w\n",DotFile),
   Writer = open(DotFile,write),
   println(Writer,"digraph links {"),
   println(Writer,"{\n  node [margin=0 fontcolor=blue fontsize=12 width=0.5 shape=dot style=filled]\n}"),
   Dot = new_map(),
   foreach(G in 1..K_com)
     % printf("%d (group %d) -> %d (group: %d) \n",I,Groups[I], X_Nodes[I], Groups[X_Nodes[I]])
     ThisGroup = [I : I in 1..Size, Groups[I] == G],
     printf(Writer,"subgraph cluster_%d {\n", G),
     foreach(T in ThisGroup)
        foreach(S in ThisGroup, S != T)
           if not(Dot.has_key([T,S].sort)) then
              printf(Writer, "%d -> %d\n",S,T),
              Dot.put([S,T].sort,1)
           end
        end
     end,
     println(Writer,"}"),
   end,
   foreach(T in 1..Size, T != X_Nodes[T])
      if not(Dot.has_key([T,X_Nodes[T]].sort)) then
          printf(Writer, "%d -> %d;\n", T, X_Nodes[T]),
          Dot.put([T,X_Nodes[T]].sort,1)
      end
   end,
   println(Writer,"}\n"),
   close(Writer),
   % ...
"""

See the attached PDF file for the output. It's generated by this command (after running the Picat program):
$ dot -Tpdf dist_vertex_claudio.dot -o dist_vertex_claudio.pdf

It's not the same as your graph, and the layout is not best, but is still quite nice...

Best,

Hakan

Hi Hakan

Excelent your graph attached ... it exactly what I am expected.
I never used the graphicz ... but I heard a lot.
