TORINO, A PRETTY THEME FOR LATEX-BEAMER
=======================================

Beamer   (http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/)   is   a   LaTeX   class
that allows  you  to  create  presentations.   Beamer  contains  several
full-featured (but a bit ugly) themes, so I wrote this pretty theme (but
with some missing features) called Torino.

#### Software Require: (on Debian-like system type in terminal)

sudo apt-get install texlive-full abntex evince latex-beamer

#### Editing the .tex files

apres.tex - change the presentation's name, departemt

#### Compiling the source using Makefile

On terminal type:

make - to compile and create the pdf file
make view - to compile, create pdf file and view pdf file with evince
make clean - to remove te outputs of pdflatex

####
