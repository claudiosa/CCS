The first thing to do is to give IPTV Simple Client the m3u file to use, which is the list of channels you want to appear in Kodi TV.

In the “General” tab choose “Local path” for the location (1).

Finally, select “M3U Play List Path” to open the Kodi File Explorer (2).



The m3u files of each country are in the m3u folder present in the add-on folder (plugin.video.catchuptvandmore). This folder m3u is hidden by default in Kodi. You need to activate the option Show hidden files and directories present “System > Media” to have access to these m3u files.

The Kodi addons folder depends on your platform:

Windows: C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Kodi\addons
Linux: /home/[user]/.kodi/addons
macOS: /Users/[user]/Library/Application Support/Kodi/addons
Android: /sdcard/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi/files/.kodi/addons
LibreELEC: /storage/.kodi/addons
Shield Android TV: /internal/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi/files/.kodi/addons
Amazon Fire: /External storage/Android/Data/org.xbmc.kodi/files/.kodi/addon
For others, you can find your “special://home” here.

Finally, go in the m3u folder by following this path:

plugin.video.catchuptvandmore/resources/m3u
Now you can choose the m3u file of you favourite country.




Finally copy and paste your country guide (again, the tv_guide_all guide contains all TV guides of all available countries)

France: http://bit.ly/tvguidefr
Belgium: http://bit.ly/tvguidebe
Italy: http://bit.ly/tvguideit
United Kingdom: http://bit.ly/tvguideunitedkingdom
All available countries: http://bit.ly/tvguideall
Programs may not be available for all channels
If the timezone of the XMLTV file is different from yours, you can adjust it using the “EPG Time Shift” setting
Finally, confirm the settings.
