The Picat interpreter uses the getline program written by Chris Thewalt. 
The getline program memorizes up to 100 of the most recent queries that 
the users have typed, and allows users to recall past queries and edit 
the current query by using Emacs editing commands. 
The following gives the editing commands:


ctrl-f	Move the cursor one position forward.
ctrl-b	Move the cursor one position backward.
ctrl-a	Move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
ctrl-e	Move the cursor to the end of the line.
ctrl-d	Delete the character under the cursor.
ctrl-h	Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
ctrl-k	Delete the characters to the right of the cursor.
ctrl-u	Delete the whole line.
ctrl-p	Load the previous query in the buffer.
ctrl-n	Load the next query in the buffer.
Note that the command ctrl-d terminates the interpreter if the line is empty and the cursor is located in the beginning of the line.
