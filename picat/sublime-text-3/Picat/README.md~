# Picat syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 3 #
# This Picat with a highlighting syntax is for Sublime Text 3
# Without ANY warranty of this process and files configuration
# I did it based in the Prolog package for Sublime

1. Copy the file: https://github.com/claudiosa/CCS/blob/master/picat/sublime-text-3/support/Picat.tmLanguage
2. Copy only this file in ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/
3. Starts the Sublime with a Picat file
(this procedure is based in a Prolog installation -- see below -- it did not work for me)

It  works for me:

1. Copy the content from this Directory -- https://github.com/claudiosa/CCS/tree/master/picat/sublime-text-3/
2. There is a directory called Picat, copy it   in  ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Cache/
   Copy all the contents into this directory
3.    Starts the Sublime with a Picat file
(this procedure works OK)

ANY IMPROVEMENTS are wellcome








# Prolog syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 2 & 3 #

This package provides syntax highlighting and automated build for the logic
programming language Prolog. It is highly work in progress, so use with care.

## Auto Build System ##
To be able to use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> automatic build, you need to define `main/0`
where you compute the solution and you also print it. For example:

```picat
main :- compute(input, Solution), writef('%t\n', [Solution]).
```

An indicator that this is not done (correctly) is the following error:

```
ERROR: call/2: Undefined procedure: main/1
ERROR:   However, there are definitions for:
ERROR:         main/0
```

## Installation ##

### Installation via Sublime Package Control ###

I recommend using the [Sublime Package Control] [1] to install this package. 
This way is much more convenient. It is named *Prolog*.
