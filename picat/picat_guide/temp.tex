\item \texttt{write\_char($FD$, $Chars$)}\index{\texttt{write\_char/2}}: This predicate writes a single character or a list of characters to a file.
\item \texttt{write\_char($Chars$)}\index{\texttt{write\_char/1}}: This predicate is the same as \texttt{write\_char(stdout,$Chars$)}.


\item \texttt{write\_char\_code($FD$, $Codes$)}\index{\texttt{write\_char\_code/2}}: This predicate writes a single character or a list of characters of the given code or list of codes to a file.
\item \texttt{write\_char\_code($Codes$)}\index{\texttt{write\_char\_code/1}}: This predicate is the same as \texttt{write\_char\_code(stdout,$Chars$)}.



\item \texttt{read\_char\_code($FD$) = $Val$}\index{\texttt{read\_char\_code/1}}: This function reads a single UTF-8 character from the file that is represented by $FD$ and returns its code point.
\item \texttt{read\_char\_code() = $Val$}\index{\texttt{read\_char\_code/0}}: This function is the same as \texttt{read\_char\_code(stdin)}.
\item \texttt{read\_char\_code($FD$, $N$) = $List$}\index{\texttt{read\_char\_code/2}}: This function reads up to $N$ UTF-8 characters from the file that is represented by $FD$.  It returns a list of code points of the characters that were read.
