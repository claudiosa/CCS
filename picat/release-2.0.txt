Some suggestions:

1. In the presentation screen
[ccs@gerzat picat]$ picat
Picat 2.0b3, (C) picat-lang.org, 2013-2016.
Picat> 

Add a line about the "help" such:
<<type "help" for first options>>


2. Inside of help option ctl-z for Linux option, 
this commands put the picat in background, should be
emphasized ctl-d for Linux systems to exit.


3. In the User Guide, please add a small example illustrating 
the usage of "Interface to Gurobi" and "Interface to GLPK"
the both command are easy to understand, but it example,
everybody maybe try it.
As soon a new version has been released I will generating a new
html version.


4. About the heuristic(S) and sequence(P,A) predicates seems to extend
the (conceptual) definitions from planning area. Probably a new
subsection in Chapter 8 should be mandatory to explain them.

5. What is mean?: "Clean up exceptions"


6. The function 'to_number' could be come illustrated (as well other equally importants) such:
Picat> X = to_number("45"),  write(X).
45X = 45
yes

Picat> X = to_number("45").           
X = 45
yes

7. [ccs@gerzat Downloads]$ picat --version
Picat version 2.0b3
OK as well as
[ccs@gerzat Downloads]$ picat --help
Usage: picat [-path Path] [-log] [-g InitGoal] PicatMainFileName Arg1 Arg2 ...
