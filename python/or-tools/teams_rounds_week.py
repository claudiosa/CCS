My Problem Formulation 

 A country has a number of soccer teams that play rounds/weeks in groups (the number of
 teams is a multiple of the number of groups).  Each round/week, a team
 plays with a group of different team, such that the same pair of teams
 never play together twice.

Problem Defintion

FROM
https://phaethonprime.wordpress.com/2019/09/04/using-google-or-tools-for-social-golfers/

To set up our social golfers, we need to think in terms of constraints that must be satisfied. There are three primary constraints:

Each golfer must be in exactly one group per day
Each golfer cannot play with a golfer theyâ€™ve played with before
Each group must contain the right number of golfers


Where p is the player number, d is the day, and g is the group number. 
X_{p,d,g}=1 when player p is playing on 
day d in group g. Let us say there are P golfers, 
D days, G groups, and Y golfers per group.

I will follow this description due its documentation on its modelling

# these will come in handy
    n_groups = n_players // players_per_group
