My Problem Formulation 

 A country has a number of soccer teams that play rounds/weeks in groups (the number of
 teams is a multiple of the number of groups).  Each round/week, a team
 plays with a group of different team, such that the same pair of teams
 never play together twice.

Problem Defintion

FROM
https://phaethonprime.wordpress.com/2019/09/04/using-google-or-tools-for-social-golfers/

To set up our social golfers, we need to think in terms of constraints that must be satisfied. There are three primary constraints:

Each golfer must be in exactly one group per day
Each golfer cannot play with a golfer theyâ€™ve played with before
Each group must contain the right number of golfers


Where p is the player number, d is the day, and g is the group number. 
X_{p,d,g}=1 when player p is playing on 
day d in group g. Let us say there are P golfers, 
D days, G groups, and Y golfers per group.

I will follow this description due its documentation on its modelling

###VERY VERY IMPORTANT
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

def f_data():

    # define the problem (use smaller numbers of players for testing)
    n_players = 15 #35
    n_days = 5
    players_per_group = 3
    return n_players, n_days, players_per_group 

# these will come in handy
''' 
   Attention
>>> n_days = 4
>>> days = list(range(n_days))
>>> print(days)
[0, 1, 2, 3]
