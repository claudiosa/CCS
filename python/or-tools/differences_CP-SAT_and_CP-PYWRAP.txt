OR-Tools provides two solvers for constraint programming:

The CP-SAT solver
The original CP solver

The CP-SAT solver is technologically superior to the original CP
solver and should be preferred in almost all situations. 
The exceptions are small problems for which solutions can
be found quickly using either solver. In those cases you may find that the original CP
solver outperforms CP-SAT.
