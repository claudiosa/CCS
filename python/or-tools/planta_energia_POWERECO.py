Problem Formulation 

Powerco has three electric power plants that supply the needs of four cities.† Each power plant can supply the following numbers of kilowatt-hours (kwh) of electricity: plant 1—35 million; plant 2—50 million; plant 3—40 million (see Table 1). The peak power demands in these cities, which occur at the same time (2 P.M.), are as follows (in kwh): city 1—45 million; city 2—20 million; city 3—30 million; city 4—30 million. The costs of sending 1 million kwh of electricity from plant to city depend on the distance the electricity must travel. Formulate an LP to minimize the cost of meeting each city’s peak power demand.


Solution: To formulate Powerco’s problem as
 an LP, we begin by defining a variable for each decision 
 that Powerco must make. Because Powerco must determine 
 how much power is sent from each plant to each city,
  we define (for i  1, 2, 3 and j  1, 2, 3, 4)

xij:  number of (million) kwh produced at plant i and 
sent to city j
