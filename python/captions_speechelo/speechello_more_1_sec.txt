Hi everyone, in this training video
we are going to learn  how to use the WhatsTV

[sPause sec=0.94 ePause]
in a very easy way, let's start with the objective.
The main objective of WhatsTV

[sPause sec=1.91 ePause]
is to make broadcasters use
messages on the air,

[sPause sec=0.16 ePause]
as fast as possible
about 15 seconds,

[sPause sec=1.35 ePause]
to achieve this objective, the first step
to take is to navigate

[sPause sec=1.74 ePause]
web WhatsApp, conversations, remembering that WhatsApp web
it's the same one you use in

[sPause sec=0.93 ePause]
a normal browser like Chrome or Firefox
everything you do there, you'll also get

[sPause sec=1.75 ePause]
to do it here.
You're going to get to play a video,

[sPause sec=0.38 ePause]
view an image,
send content, reply to message and so on,
etc.

[sPause sec=1.86 ePause]
So the first step is to find
a conversation with interesting content,

[sPause sec=1.41 ePause]
let's say ...
it's a conversation here that's currently

[sPause sec=0.74 ePause]
selected
the number 7512 at the end of this contact

[sPause sec=1.07 ePause]
The next step is to click the orange button
and the system will take a screenshot of that content

[sPause sec=0.91 ePause]
that came in this talking.
Remember, in this capture (screenshot) process it only receives

[sPause sec=0.42 ePause]
the content that came in the talking, and
the one that was sent is not captured, I'm going to

[sPause sec=1.94 ePause]
pause  in the capture process, because
I don't need to wait

[sPause sec=0.53 ePause]
for the whole process to finish.
I can stop it

[sPause sec=0.69 ePause]
The result of the capture process is in the same order
that the conversation arrived, so

[sPause sec=1.27 ePause]
the most recent item of this talking  it’s
a video, then an image and so on

[sPause sec=1.37 ePause]
Now if I want to put it on the air,  I click
on the black arrow to send it at the bottom window,

[sPause sec=0.32 ePause]
and then I will click on this video,
or in this image, or in this text,  and so on...

[sPause sec=0.87 ePause]
Ready, now a can start for another
capture, looking for more contents

[sPause sec=1.27 ePause]
to put on the air, now I’m going to use this video...
Ready, in this way I’m going to create a

[sPause sec=1.25 ePause]
sequence of interesting contents
to be presented on the air

[sPause sec=1.62 ePause]
I did here the capture of three different contacts,
the next step now is to

[sPause sec=0.96 ePause]
moderate that content
In the first step of this moderation (adjustments)

[sPause sec=0.78 ePause]
I define if the photo of this contact can
go into the air, if that’s the case,

[sPause sec=1.79 ePause]
one of those photos have political campaign,
or any other reason that

[sPause sec=0.34 ePause]
you don't want to transmit, you just
have to give double - click on this photo to make

[sPause sec=0.31 ePause]
it hidden, double-click again and the photo
reappears in the names column.

[sPause sec=1.74 ePause]
If you press a double-click, you can
change the name of that contact, also

[sPause sec=1.92 ePause]
define a geo-location to that
contact, it can be a district, a

[sPause sec=1.59 ePause]
region, or a city, depending  on
the scope of the station, finally

[sPause sec=1.68 ePause]
we will make the correction of the text
properly through a double - click

[sPause sec=0.22 ePause]
you will fix the text by
correcting  English errors or by

[sPause sec=1.32 ePause]
removing some parts of the text that are not
interesting, and now this  sequence

[sPause sec=0.22 ePause]
 of items captured is  ready to take place
on the air, every line

[sPause sec=1.41 ePause]
that I'm navigating is going to
transform into a slide to put on the air.

[sPause sec=1.25 ePause]
You can think like a  PowerPoint slide. I'm going to

[sPause sec=0.45 ePause]
press the play to exhibit it on the air.
Once the play button is pressed it’s going to generate

[sPause sec=0.49 ePause]
a presentation with the content which effectively
 goes on air (to be broadcasted)

[sPause sec=0.12 ePause]
Well, then we had five lines there whose
generated five slides here, and

[sPause sec=1.56 ePause]
How does this process technically work?  This PC
that you are watching the execution,  has

[sPause sec=0.28 ePause]
been connected with the video console (control panel)
via HDMI, NDI, or display board

[sPause sec=1.20 ePause]
at the right time, the switcher operator
with his PC will be sending to the TV LCD

[sPause sec=1.40 ePause]
and the program presenter will move
on to interact with the slides.

[sPause sec=0.41 ePause]
Now he is watching  a video
of Eduardo Pereira, it will start this playing

[sPause sec=1.70 ePause]
with the space key in
the keyboard is pressed, the presenter

[sPause sec=0.96 ePause]
will view that video and comment,
that is the way the switcher operator presses the button "S"

[sPause sec=0.16 ePause]
to go to another slide during the
transmission, which in this case is an image,

[sPause sec=1.04 ePause]
press the button "S" once more and finally
a text appears and

[sPause sec=0.61 ePause]
the presenter will read
that text on the air, they will say the following:

[sPause sec=1.97 ePause]
Look, "Eduardo Pereira, is saying that
he has very bad chest pain,

[sPause sec=0.28 ePause]
palpitations and sometimes he thinks
he is going to faint". He was diagnosed with gastritis.

[sPause sec=0.79 ePause]
So, the presenter will be able to
comment  on all the slides, once again

[sPause sec=1.49 ePause]
the switcher operator using the "S" button will advance
to the next slide, if the

[sPause sec=1.89 ePause]
presenter requests that
he returns to the previous slide, he has

[sPause sec=0.25 ePause]
to press the "V" key to return. There is a set of buttons
that will make it easier

[sPause sec=1.62 ePause]
for the switcher operator to navigate on the slides,
well as adjusting

[sPause sec=1.35 ePause]
them as his needs, so that the presentation occurs
 in the best way possible

[sPause sec=0.25 ePause]
once the presentation of all
those slides is on the air, the video console

[sPause sec=1.77 ePause]
can be unplugged of this computer, and the
WhatsTV operator can give an "Esc" and

[sPause sec=1.23 ePause]
to give continuity in this capture process.
So, that sequence of

[sPause sec=0.41 ePause]
slides can now be deleted
 by clicking on the eraser button,

[sPause sec=0.31 ePause]
click on accept and start
a new set of captures, you only

[sPause sec=1.58 ePause]
need to click once a more new  conversation,
make the screen capture once more and place the material down,

[sPause sec=1.79 ePause]
click on one more conversation and place
the content that may be considered interesting

[sPause sec=1.13 ePause]
below and
take a look that I am already generating a new

[sPause sec=0.28 ePause]
sequence of slides to transmit to the air,
It is the normal usage for  WhatsTV.

[sPause sec=1.36 ePause]
Now we are going to give a view to
the poll  usage generated through this button.

[sPause sec=0.99 ePause]
It will open that window and the fields
above must be filled in, in the first field

[sPause sec=1.65 ePause]
I place a question for a poll about any subject,
I will give an example here

[sPause sec=0.99 ePause]
about the increase in the salary of councilors
Do you agree or disagree?

[sPause sec=1.11 ePause]
In the form below enter
the keywords "hashtag" #agree

[sPause sec=0.30 ePause]
and "hashtag" #disagree. These keywords are
used by the audience to

[sPause sec=1.44 ePause]
express his opinion regarding
the poll via WhatsApp, he will send

[sPause sec=1.68 ePause]
"hashtag" #agree if he is in favor of the
salary increase or he will send

[sPause sec=0.60 ePause]
"hashtag" #disagree if he is not in favor.
At the next step I can press

[sPause sec=1.89 ePause]
the orange button to perform the current vote counting,
in this case, it did not find

[sPause sec=1.44 ePause]
any answer taking into account that
we are in a WhatsApp without participations,

[sPause sec=1.66 ePause]
I can write random values so that
we can simulate an environment

[sPause sec=0.95 ePause]
as realistic as possible. Observe that
the slide was created in the listing.

[sPause sec=1.86 ePause]
Now, I can click on the Play button to execute
the poll presentation, I have here

[sPause sec=1.92 ePause]
the first slide that was captured
previously, go to the second slide

[sPause sec=0.58 ePause]
and, finally, I got to my poll,
the poll sheet has three

[sPause sec=1.68 ePause]
different stages (phases), the first stage is
used in the first segment of the program

[sPause sec=0.10 ePause]
when we make the call to the poll
then the presenter on air will say the following,

[sPause sec=0.99 ePause]
"Dear viewers, today we are having
a poll via WhatsApp about the"

[sPause sec=0.66 ePause]
"increase in salary of the councilors,
do you agree or disagree?" At that moment,

[sPause sec=1.53 ePause]
the switcher operator must press the space button once
so that the poll slides goes to the

[sPause sec=0.55 ePause]
options and the presenter continues on the air
if you agree, send "hashtag"

[sPause sec=0.09 ePause]
#agree for our WhatsApp No xxxxx if you
do not agree to send or "hashtag" #disagree

[sPause sec=1.17 ePause]
participate, send your comments
along with your vote

[sPause sec=0.60 ePause]
and the switcher operator withdraws
the poll and gives continuity to the

[sPause sec=1.23 ePause]
program in another segment of the show
when the director wants to present the

[sPause sec=0.10 ePause]
partial result or even the final result,
the operator presses once more the

[sPause sec=1.86 ePause]
space bar to show the current poll result,
then the presenter will be

[sPause sec=0.78 ePause]
able to count the poll result
by saying "Look at our viewers they did not"

[sPause sec=0.19 ePause]
"like that salary increase"
"hashtag" #disagree is gaining with 70.9

[sPause sec=1.23 ePause]
percent of the votes, once again
when the PC is removed from the transmission, the operator can

[sPause sec=1.11 ePause]
give an “Esc” reminding that the poll sheet
is going to be used throughout the entire program,

[sPause sec=0.27 ePause]
so it must be
activated the lock through a double click

[sPause sec=0.45 ePause]
and in this way the system will not
exclude the poll and whenever you want

[sPause sec=1.53 ePause]
to present the poll again,
you only have to double click

[sPause sec=1.90 ePause]
on the poll by clicking the orange button
to update the

[sPause sec=0.24 ePause]
voting count, then close and ready,
and the poll is ready and updated

[sPause sec=0.30 ePause]
to put on the air. So, the poll is a resource
very easy and dynamic to be used

[sPause sec=0.51 ePause]
in your programming.  Another important
issue is the changing
layout visualized by the public.

[sPause sec=1.62 ePause]
The layout that you have been
seen before when it was transmitted  with
the fonts

[sPause sec=1.35 ePause]
in white and the blue as a background.
It was previously configured for you to fulfill

[sPause sec=1.74 ePause]
the identity of your program in question.
You can have other layouts completely different,

[sPause sec=0.04 ePause]
I am going to grab another layout
called “Globo V2” and I am going
press a play it

[sPause sec=1.73 ePause]
and you  will see that it is a
completely different  layout,  you can see our

[sPause sec=0.48 ePause]
You can see our poll is being shown with  a different layout,
 you will be able to build as

[sPause sec=0.57 ePause]
many layouts as you need,
using the button aside from the Play button

[sPause sec=1.86 ePause]
you will be able to select any layout
that will be used at that moment.

[sPause sec=1.90 ePause]
I will select one more slide and
I will show you a layout completely different

[sPause sec=0.86 ePause]
from the previous one,
see how it is interesting, even the transition

[sPause sec=1.74 ePause]
between one slide and the other
is completely different,

[sPause sec=0.75 ePause]
These are
instructions necessary for the
operation of WhatsTV on the air,

[sPause sec=0.24 ePause]
follow the news of  WhatsTV on our
Instagram @Watches TV official,

[sPause sec=0.26 ePause]
a big hug for you and see you next time
[Músic]
