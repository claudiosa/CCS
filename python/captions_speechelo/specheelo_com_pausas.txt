[startSpeech v=X-Loud startSpeech]Hi everyone[endSpeech], 
in this training video, we are going to learn how to use the WhatsTV
in a very easy way.
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause] 
Let's start with the objective. 

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
The main objective of WhatsTV is to make broadcasters use messages on the air, 
[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
as fast as possible about 15 seconds,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 to achieve this objective, the first step to take is to navigate web WhatsApp, 

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
conversations,

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
remembering that WhatsApp web it's the same one you use in a 

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
normal browser
like Chrome or Firefox everything you do there, 

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
you'll also get to do it here. 

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
You're going to get to play a video, view an image, send content, reply to a message, and so on, etc. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
So the first step is to find a conversation with interesting content,

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
let's say ... 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
it's a conversation here that's currently
selected the number 7512 at the end of this contact.

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
The next step is to click the orange button and the system will take a screenshot of that content that came in this talking. 

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]

Remember, in this capture (screenshot) process it only receives the content that came in the talking,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 and the one that was sent is not captured, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
I'm going to pause in the capture process because I don't need to wait
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
for the whole process to finish. 

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
I can stop it.

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
The result of the capture process is in the same order that the conversation arrived, so

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
 the most recent item of this talking  it’s a video, then an image and so on.

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
Now if I want to put it on the air,  I click on the black arrow to send it at the bottom window,

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
and then I will click on this video, 
or in this image, or in this text,  and so on ...

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
Ready, now a can start for another capture, looking for more contents
to put on the air, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
now I’m going to use this video... 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
Ready, in this way I’m going to create a sequence
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
of interesting contents to be presented on the air 

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
I did here the capture of three different contacts, the next step now is to

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 moderate that content In the first step of this moderation (adjustments) 

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
I define if the photo of this contact can go into the air, if that’s the case.

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
One of those photos has a political campaign, or any other reason that you don't want to transmit, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
you just have to give double - click on this photo to make 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
it hidden, double-click again and the photo reappears in the names column. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]

If you press a double-click, you can change the name of that contact, also
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
define a geo-location to that contact, it can be a district, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
a region, or a city, depending on the scope of the station, finally, 
[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
we will make the correction of the text properly through a double - click you will fix the text by correcting  English errors
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
or by removing some parts of the text that are not interesting, and 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
now this sequence of items captured is ready to take place on the air, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
every line that I'm navigating is going to transform into a slide to put on the air. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
You can think like a  PowerPoint slide. 

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]

I'm going to press the play to exhibit it on the air. 
Once the play button is pressed it’s going to generate
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 a presentation with the content which effectively  goes on air (to be broadcasted)

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 Well, then we had five lines there whose  generated five slides here, and

[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
How does this process technically work? 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
This PC that you are watching the execution,  has been connected with the video console 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
a control panel, via HDMI, NDI, or display board at the right time, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
the switcher operator with his PC will be sending to the TV LCD 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
and the program presenter will move on to interact with the slides. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
Now he is watching  a video of Eduardo Pereira, it will start this playing

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 with the space key in the keyboard is pressed, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
the presenter will view that video and comment,

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
that is the way the switcher operator presses the button "S" to go to another slide during the transmission, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
which in this case is an image, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
press the button "S" once more and finally, a text appears and
 the presenter will read that text on the air, they will say the following: 
[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
Look,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 "Eduardo Pereira, is saying that he has very bad chest pain,
palpitations and sometimes he thinks he is going to faint". 

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
He was diagnosed with gastritis.
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 So, the presenter will be able to comment on all the slides, once again
[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
 the switcher operator using the "S" button will advance to the next slide, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
if the presenter requests that he returns to the previous slide, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
he has to press the "V" key to return. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
here is a set of buttons that will make it easier for the switcher operator to navigate on the slides, well as adjusting them as his needs,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
so that the presentation occurs in the best way possible once the presentation of all those slides is on the air,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
the video console can be unplugged of this computer,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 and the  WhatsTV operator can give an "Esc" and 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
to give continuity in this capture process. 
[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
So, that sequence of
slides can now be deleted by clicking on the eraser button, click on accept
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 and start a new set of captures,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
you only need to click once a more new conversation, make the screen capture once more and 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
place the material down, click on one more conversation and place the content that may be considered interesting below and
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
take a look that I am already generating a new
sequence of slides to transmit to the air. It is the normal usage for  WhatsTV.
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
Now we are going to give a view to the poll usage generated through this button. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
It will open that window and the fields above must be filled in, in the first field
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 I place a question for a poll about any subject,  I will give an example here
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
about the increase in salary of councilors Do you agree or disagree?
 In the form below enter the keywords "hashtag" agree
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
and "hashtag" disagree. 
These keywords are used by the audience to express his opinion regarding  the poll via WhatsApp,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 he will send "hashtag" agree if he is in favor of the salary increase
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 or he will send
"hashtag" disagree 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
if he is not in favor. 

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
At the next step I can press the orange button to perform the current vote counting,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 in this case, it did not find any answer taking into account
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 that we are in a WhatsApp without participations, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
I can write random values so that we can simulate an environment
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
as realistic as possible. 
observe that the slide was created in the listing.
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 Now, I can click on the Play button to execute the poll presentation, I have here
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 the first slide that was captured previously, go to the second slide,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 and finally, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
I got to my poll, the poll sheet has three different stages (phases),
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 the first stage is used in the first segment of the program when we make the call to the poll 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
then the presenter on air will say the following,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 "Dear  viewers, today we are having a poll via WhatsApp about the"
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
"increase in the salary of the councilors, do you agree or disagree?"
[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
At that moment, the switcher operator must press the space button once 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
so that the poll slides go to the options
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 and the presenter continues on the air 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
if you agree, send "hashtag" agree for our WhatsApp Number is ex-ex-ex-ex
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 if you do not agree  to send or "hashtag" disagree
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 participate, send your comments along with your vote and the switcher operator withdraws the poll and
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 gives continuity to the
 program in another segment of the show when the director wants to present the partial result 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
or even the final result, the operator presses once more the space bar to show the current poll result, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
then the presenter will be able to count the poll result by saying:

[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 "Look at our viewers they did not" "like that salary increase" "hashtag" disagree is gaining with 70.9 percent of the votes, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
once again when the PC is removed from the transmission,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
the operator can give an “Esc” reminding that the poll sheet is going to be used throughout the entire program, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
so it must be activated the lock through a double click
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
and in this way the system will not exclude the poll
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 and whenever you want to present the poll again, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
you only have to double click on the poll by clicking the orange button to update the voting count, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
then close and ready, and the poll is ready and updated to put on the air. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
So, the poll is a resource very easy 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
and dynamic to be used in your programming. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
Another important issue is the changing layout visualized by the public. 
[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
The layout that you have been seen before when it was transmitted with the fonts in white and the blue as a background. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
It was previously configured for you to fulfill the identity of your program in question. 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
You can have other layouts completely different,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 I am going to grab another layout called “Globo V2” and I am going  press a play it
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 and you will see that it is a completely different layout.
[sPause sec=0.6 ePause]
You can see our poll is being shown with a different layout,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
  you will be able to build as many layouts as you need, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
using the button aside from the Play button you will be able to select any layout that will be used at that moment.
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 I will select one more slide and I will show you a layout completely different
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
 from the previous one, see how it is interesting, even the transition between one slide and the other is completely different, 
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
These are   instructions necessary for the operation of WhatsTV on the air,
[sPause sec=0.2 ePause]
